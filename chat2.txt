14/07/2015, 15:58 - hp Czy: Dunnoe what age is good to teach them that, but from what i see, most younger parents all dont teach thier kids that likenin forever. So much the parents become slaves to thier child when they grow up

14/07/2015, 16:07 - hp Czy: Train them well and they grow up to be respectable humans, spoil them and they become trash
14/07/2015, 16:07 - hp Czy: Seen too many trashs nowadays
14/07/2015, 16:26 - Xinlan: Basically we need our baby to sleep for one very basic reason
14/07/2015, 16:26 - Xinlan: Only when they sleep then we can rest

14/07/2015, 16:36 - Xinlan: But
14/07/2015, 16:37 - Xinlan: We shall not succumb to use a maid so easily!
14/07/2015, 16:37 - Xinlan: We will take. Care of the baby and the house on our own!
14/07/2015, 16:37 - hp Czy: Save moeny lor, 1.2 to 1.5k a month add up quite alot x12

14/07/2015, 16:38 - hp Czy: Cant buy time with money lol
14/07/2015, 16:38 - Xinlan: üò≠
14/07/2015, 16:38 - Victor Cheong: I will say that time different leh
14/07/2015, 16:38 - Victor Cheong: That time things were cheaper and less stressful
14/07/2015, 16:38 - Xinlan: She sacrificed her job
14/07/2015, 16:38 - Xinlan: And ultimately sacrificed her marriage
14/07/2015, 16:39 - Xinlan: So we are all she have
14/07/2015, 16:39 - hp Czy: Thats dumb lol
14/07/2015, 16:39 - hp Czy: Its nver wise to sac marriage
14/07/2015, 16:39 - Xinlan: It's not that simple
14/07/2015, 16:39 - Xinlan: When a marriage breaks down
14/07/2015, 16:40 - hp Czy: Cause when old, its not ur kids that will always be with u, its ur hubby
14/07/2015, 16:40 - Xinlan: It's actually due to accumulation of reasons
14/07/2015, 16:40 - hp Czy: Kids have thier own family in thenend
14/07/2015, 16:40 - hp Czy: Haha, actually i think kids are mainly the reason why marriages breakdown
14/07/2015, 16:41 - Xinlan: See Ivan that's why u should be very nice to me
14/07/2015, 16:41 - Xinlan: Cos when u are old
14/07/2015, 16:41 - Xinlan: I am all that u have
14/07/2015, 16:43 - GZ: Agreed
14/07/2015, 16:44 - hp Czy: Infact, the main reason is cause wife puts the kids first priority. And hubby become low priority
14/07/2015, 16:44 - hp Czy: Then hubby got fedup and go out find someone that puts him in top priority
14/07/2015, 16:46 - GZ: Lol agreed too
14/07/2015, 16:46 - GZ: I once heard on radio
14/07/2015, 16:46 - GZ: Our MediaCorp couple
14/07/2015, 16:46 - GZ: Lee Min lun and chen Yu yun
14/07/2015, 16:46 - GZ: I think that's their name
14/07/2015, 16:46 - GZ: They got talk
14/07/2015, 16:46 - GZ: Even after kids
14/07/2015, 16:46 - GZ: I'm still ur hubby
14/07/2015, 16:46 - GZ: U must put me as ur focus too
14/07/2015, 16:47 - GZ: And not let the world revolve round the kids
14/07/2015, 16:48 - hp Czy: 2nd reason is wife puts kid at top priority and neglects herself. She doesnt dress up, doesnt cleanup, have no interest, have no hobby.
14/07/2015, 16:50 - hp Czy: What else is left in her that is acttractive or have same interest as the hubby thats making the hubby feel he have a life partner that can walk down the road with him? That doesnt make him feel detest?

15/07/2015, 13:17 - Victor Cheong: Only played the beta. But so far don't think so?

15/07/2015, 13:21 - hp Czy: Lol
15/07/2015, 13:21 - hp Czy: Ist?? I dont find any similarity
15/07/2015, 13:25 - Victor Cheong: Might be good to maybe have a survey first then decide
15/07/2015, 14:41 - hp Czy: Ahhh soooo damn tired, not enough sleep after 2 hrs plus of workout yesterday makes today feel like a freaking torture...
15/07/2015, 15:26 - hp Ivan: Where did u train?
15/07/2015, 15:29 - hp Czy: 1hr plus gym, 30plus min routine, another 30 for stretching and station training at home
15/07/2015, 15:31 - hp Czy: Search for brandon carter's six pack in google
15/07/2015, 15:32 - hp Czy: I am using his regime and some other he posts on fb, all is 20sec workout 20 sec rest repetition. Can increase to 30sec if you like for the workout to be longer...
15/07/2015, 15:33 - hp Czy: Helps keeps most of ur body active with a very short and intense workout. Quite gd imo, but using that to get six pack is kind of a dream on.... no way thats enough
15/07/2015, 15:34 - hp Czy: Quite fun too u can do it with xl, i trying to get my mum to complete 1 routine... she did the abdominal core strengthening one fully but still cant make it for the cardio one
15/07/2015, 15:36 - hp Czy: Situp training... if 40 is max, do 36 32 36 28 16 kind of training, i alt it with my pushup
15/07/2015, 15:36 - hp Czy: Alt as in 1 day 1 kind
15/07/2015, 15:37 - GZ: One day zy I hope I can do with u
15/07/2015, 15:37 - GZ: Lol
15/07/2015, 15:37 - hp Czy: U..... u say say only
15/07/2015, 15:37 - hp Czy: Forever wont happen one
15/07/2015, 15:40 - hp Czy: Pushup training wise.... always do in 5 sets for start till u reach 20 each set. Raise it up by 1 each time per set so its 5sets of 10...5 sets of 11... e.g. 
Once u hit 20, start dividing the 100 oushups into 3 sets of 30, once completed, change to 5 sets of 25... the raise is up to u. Alternating works wonders

23/07/2015, 17:38 - hp Czy: Its worth the price
23/07/2015, 17:38 - hp Hongxin: Chor! That's my phrase
23/07/2015, 17:39 - hp Czy: Oh that...saw it with vic that time

23/07/2015, 17:40 - hp Czy: Lol... that shop menu and decor abit not appealing
23/07/2015, 17:42 - hp Czy: Its top quality cakes that you dont eat everyday... yet it makes all the prima deli and four leaves cake feels like they taste like shit

23/07/2015, 17:45 - hp Czy: Isetan cream puff is not bad, but again.. not worth the price, slightly pricer by abit. Still, one of the better options around. Thier cakes are definitely overpriced...
23/07/2015, 17:46 - hp Czy: The crossant sweet snacks that is beside westgate isetan sells sweet snacks thats really good with coffee at a good price
23/07/2015, 17:49 - hp Czy: The sushi shop that me and vic ate at westgate.... one of the best in sg... not overpriced thanks to their quality but definitely a heart ache after eating a meal. Definitely goes close to 50plus just by quenching ur crave

25/09/2015, 17:35 - hp Hongxin: A monk decides to meditate alone, away from his monastery. He takes his boat out to the middle of the lake, moors it there, closes his eyes and begins his meditation.

After a few hours of undisturbed silence, he suddenly feels the bump of another boat colliding with his own. With his eyes still closed, he senses his anger rising, and by the time he opens his eyes, he is ready to scream at the boatman who dared disturb his meditation.

But when he opens his eyes, he sees it‚Äôs an empty boat that had probably got untethered and floated to the middle of the lake.
At that moment, the monk achieves self-realization, and understands that the anger is within him; it merely needs the bump of an external object to provoke it out of him.

From then on, whenever he comes across someone who irritates him or provokes him to anger, he reminds himself, ‚ÄúThe other person is merely an empty boat. The anger is within me.‚Äù

Some useful timeless tips

1. Throw out nonessential numbers. This includes age, weight and height. Let the doctors worry about them. That is why you pay 'them'

2. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull you down.

3. Keep learning. Learn more about the computer, crafts, gardening, whatever.. Never let the brain idle. 'An idle mind is the devil's workshop.' And the devil's name is Alzheimer's.

4. Enjoy the simple things.

5.. Laugh often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath.

6. The tears happen. Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person, who is with us our entire life, is ourselves. Be ALIVE while you are alive.

7. Surround yourself with what you love , whether it's family, pets, keepsakes, music, plants, hobbies, whatever. Your home is your refuge.

8. Cherish your health: If it is good, preserve it. If it is unstable, improve it. If it is beyond what you can improve, get help.

9. Don't take guilt trips. Take a trip to the mall, even to the next county; to a foreign country but NOT to where the guilt is.

10. Tell the people you love that you love them, at every opportunity.
AND ALWAYS REMEMBER :Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.

We all need to live life to its fullest each day, Worry about nothing, pray about everything!!!

04/02/2016, 23:37 - hp Hongxin: Depends on where you are.
I think reservist is best for sales people.. Haha
04/02/2016, 23:38 - GZ: haha

04/02/2016, 23:39 - hp Hongxin: You should have someone covering you.
04/02/2016, 23:47 - hp Czy: Then u give ur sales commision to others?
04/02/2016, 23:47 - hp Czy: No la, sales people hate reservist, time is money for them
04/02/2016, 23:48 - hp Czy: NS is actually very gd, cause nowadays the parents are like shit
04/02/2016, 23:50 - hp Czy: Dunnoe how to discipline thiet child, all turn out gu nian plus selfish to the core, not to mention cant take abit of hardship.... when grow up high chance will just rip off the parents money and throw them on the road
04/02/2016, 23:51 - hp Czy: Last time children have to work to feed themself, all turn out very gd at taking hardship and have a big heart, selflessness is thier morality
04/02/2016, 23:55 - hp Czy: Work wise, if u like ur work, and want to work more, then u wouldnt say no time. If u work just cause u need money and much to say hate it, then u would say no time, rather go work, cause both ns and work is bad, just which one not as bad
05/02/2016, 00:01 - hp Czy: Hmmm, sg ns, when compare to what israelist go through in thier 3 yrs army, is really nothing more than country trying to help the parents discipline their kids.
Reservist wise, its to ensure u peeps still know how to wear uniforms... pointless but its exactly this that allows the sg to still say it have a gd amount of soldiers... or would u rather everyone be serving 4 or 5 yrs of ns...
05/02/2016, 00:18 - 4/1 EdwarD: Y must compare with israelist?
05/02/2016, 00:18 - 4/1 EdwarD: Can compare to USA ma
05/02/2016, 00:18 - 4/1 EdwarD: They don't need serve
05/02/2016, 00:18 - 4/1 EdwarD: We shldnt do comparison
05/02/2016, 00:19 - hp Czy: Lol if u need me to explain why usa no need serve
05/02/2016, 00:19 - 4/1 EdwarD: No need
05/02/2016, 00:20 - 4/1 EdwarD: My point is y must compare
05/02/2016, 00:20 - hp Czy: To be gd or bad
05/02/2016, 00:20 - hp Czy: Theres always a compare
05/02/2016, 00:20 - hp Czy: Else dont talk about something is gd or bad
05/02/2016, 00:20 - 4/1 EdwarD: So u compare Israel
05/02/2016, 00:20 - 4/1 EdwarD: I compare USA
05/02/2016, 00:21 - 4/1 EdwarD: Fair?
05/02/2016, 00:21 - hp Czy: Its gd example too
05/02/2016, 00:21 - hp Czy: Usa and sg army
05/02/2016, 00:21 - hp Czy: U wanna send ur children to usa army instead of sg??
05/02/2016, 00:21 - hp Czy: Wow...
05/02/2016, 00:22 - 4/1 EdwarD: Nope I wan send my children to USA becos they dun need serve ns there
05/02/2016, 00:22 - hp Czy: And be gu nians there? Grow up to be selfish peeps...
05/02/2016, 00:23 - hp Czy: So many gays there that they actually need to government to make it legal already lol
05/02/2016, 00:23 - 4/1 EdwarD: Mark zuckerberg is gu Niang?
05/02/2016, 00:23 - 4/1 EdwarD: Bill gate is gu Niang?
05/02/2016, 00:23 - 4/1 EdwarD: U shldnt generalize
05/02/2016, 00:23 - hp Czy: Yea, they are, if u compare to any soldier in usa army
05/02/2016, 00:24 - 4/1 EdwarD: Gu Niang or not depends on parenting
05/02/2016, 00:24 - 4/1 EdwarD: Not army
05/02/2016, 00:24 - hp Czy: Problem is, sg parents are geting more and more lousy
05/02/2016, 00:24 - 4/1 EdwarD: Even if they are gu niang they are still more successful than us
05/02/2016, 00:24 - hp Czy: Look at the sch now
05/02/2016, 00:24 - 4/1 EdwarD: Face it
05/02/2016, 00:24 - hp Czy: Teachers cant even punish the kids
05/02/2016, 00:25 - hp Czy: Face what? How do u deem what is successful?
05/02/2016, 00:25 - hp Czy: Just by money?
05/02/2016, 00:25 - hp Czy: First u tell me dont compare
05/02/2016, 00:25 - hp Czy: Now u trying to make me compare... gosh... make up ur mond
05/02/2016, 00:25 - hp Czy: Mind*
05/02/2016, 00:27 - hp Czy: Oh ya, just to note, most of the kids that have maids will eant to bring thier maids to army
05/02/2016, 00:33 - hp Czy: Its funny in the movies but thats whats happening. The only thing that sg army is doing wrong, is being overprotectivr and not concentrating on training enough, what can be done in 2 yrs can be done in 1, cause selflessness can be trained in 6 months, seasoning can be done in the other 6, if the worthless person still will be selfish and gunian after all that, he will be for the rest of his life.
05/02/2016, 00:38 - hp Czy: And gz, waking up early for 2 wks is really hard, yea, but its actually just 2 weeks....Williams been doing it almost everyday...
05/02/2016, 10:06 - hp Ivan: Haha agree

16/02/2016, 17:54 - GZ: Its a track failure
16/02/2016, 17:54 - GZ: Rails
16/02/2016, 17:54 - GZ: The two metal piece that train rides on
16/02/2016, 17:54 - GZ: There was some underlying failure
16/02/2016, 17:54 - GZ: And train had to proceed at a slower speed
16/02/2016, 17:55 - Xinlan: Mechanical fault?
16/02/2016, 17:55 - GZ: Yup consider
16/02/2016, 17:55 - GZ: Electrical mechanical
16/02/2016, 17:55 - Xinlan: How can it be considered electrical?
16/02/2016, 17:56 - GZ: Coz in sg we use a system which is fail safe to detect
16/02/2016, 17:56 - GZ: So whenever there is any noted failure
16/02/2016, 17:56 - GZ: The track will be down
16/02/2016, 17:56 - GZ: N thus train cannot proceed n come to a e. brake
16/02/2016, 17:57 - GZ: In a way its impozsible for trains to kiss trains in sg
16/02/2016, 17:57 - GZ: Not like other countries

16/02/2016, 17:59 - GZ: In order to determine if the track is down or up
16/02/2016, 18:00 - GZ: We in a way use a continuity test to determine if the flow from the transmitter to the receiver is constant
16/02/2016, 18:00 - GZ: So if Tx or Rx fails
16/02/2016, 18:00 - GZ: The track will down
16/02/2016, 18:00 - GZ: This is electrical
16/02/2016, 18:00 - GZ: There are of coz many other underlying components
16/02/2016, 18:01 - GZ: This is just one of the fault tree component
16/02/2016, 18:02 - Xinlan: Chim
16/02/2016, 18:02 - GZ: Basically

16/02/2016, 18:03 - GZ: And in jurong east u always hear there is a train ahead
16/02/2016, 18:03 - GZ: N thus the train stops here
16/02/2016, 18:03 - Xinlan: Ya I know
16/02/2016, 18:04 - GZ: Coz the zone behind a train is a 0/0 zone
