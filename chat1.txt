31 Dec 2014 11:52 - Noelle Hui Fen YONG: Haha that's because it is a stereotype. 

It is true that there are Christian fundamentalists out there just as there are fundamentalists for every religion. 

It is down to the fallen nature of men and proves only so much more that we are in need of God.

When thinking abt stereotypes, consider: Do you think your own Christian friends like Victor would write such articles? Christians who love God will love their fellow men.
Not everyone is so extreme :)
31 Dec 2014 11:52 - hp Czy: Well most christians go to church ask for fogiveness

31 Dec 2014 13:43 - 4/1 EdwarD: Life's Journey ... 


üöÇüöãüöãüöãüöã

Life is like a journey on a train...
with its stations...
with changes of routes...
and with accidents !

üöÇüöãüöãüöãüöã
We board this train when we are born and our parents are the ones who get our ticket.
üöÇüöãüöãüöãüöã
We believe they will always travel on this train with us.
üöÇüöãüöãüöãüöã
However, at some station our parents will get off the train, leaving us alone on this journey.
üöÇüöãüöãüöãüöã
As time goes by, other passengers will board the train, many of whom will be significant - our siblings, friends, children, and even the love of our life.
üöÇüöãüöãüöãüöã
Many will get off during the journey and leave a permanent vacuum in our lives.
üöÇüöãüöãüöãüöã
Many will go so unnoticed that we won't even know when they vacated their seats and got off the train !
üöÇüöãüöãüöãüöã
This train ride will be full of joy, sorrow, fantasy, expectations, hellos, good-byes, and farewells.
üöÇüöãüöãüöã
A good journey is helping, loving, having a good relationship with all co passengers...
and making sure that we give our best to make their journey comfortable.
üöÇüöãüöãüöãüöã
The mystery of this fabulous journey is :
We do not know at which station we ourselves are going to get off.
üöÇüöãüöãüöãüöã
So, we must live in the best way - adjust, forget, forgive and offer the best of what we have.
üöÇüöãüöãüöãüöã
It is important to do this because when the time comes for us to leave our seat... we should leave behind beautiful memories for those who will continue to travel on the train of life."
üöÇüöãüöãüöãüöã
Thank you all for being part of this journey.

Have a blessed 2015 ahead  !
31 Dec 2014 13:49 - hp Czy: Lol a journey to die
31 Dec 2014 13:51 - hp Czy: In the end when you leave ur seat... and the people who remebers you leave thier seat, memories doesnt matter anymore

31 Dec 2014 13:53 - hp Czy: For even heros and legends and the celestial beings doesnt exists in the time that they arent meant to be in the future or pass
31 Dec 2014 13:59 - hp Czy: What pass is pass but in the remaining time we have, whether we choose to be on the same carriage or be on a totally different train, tats still to be seen. Cause theres people who are on a same train but never met up, cause one prioritize to see the oncoming scenary while the other wishes only to see the scenaries left behind

1 Jan 22:14 - hp Hongxin: Gosh.. That might easily be the birthday present from the wife.
1 Jan 22:25 - hp Hongxin: @TODAYonline: New Year's Eve stampede kills 35 in Shanghai after fake money thrown from building http://t.co/txIZdKugSp http://t.co/I59VFoB37d
1 Jan 22:58 - hp Czy: In sg, no one will bother
1 Jan 22:58 - hp Czy: Y? All would have already had the concept money wont come so easy
2 Jan 08:11 - hp Hongxin: <Media omitted>
2 Jan 08:11 - hp Hongxin: Active & Destructive = Emo!
2 Jan 08:43 - hp Czy: Case by case basis, if the person is already wrking 12 hrs a day
2 Jan 08:43 - hp Czy: And the spouse is already having to take care of everything including ur parents
2 Jan 08:43 - hp Czy: First reaction = fake
2 Jan 08:44 - hp Czy: 2nd reaction = truthful but feel like shit
2 Jan 08:45 - hp Czy: 3rd reaction for sounds like alot of responsibility is crap responsw that doesnt fit any situation except when bitches sneers at one another
2 Jan 08:46 - hp Czy: 4th reaction is frm my sis, tats not emo, just selfish
2 Jan 08:47 - hp Czy: "Are u going to spend even fewer night at hm now?" Is the one and only true response in my proposed situation
2 Jan 08:50 - hp Czy: Cause when money is already abundant to provide ur basic needs, any more of it to exchange with selling ur time is unworthy unless hx, u feel ur wife isnt more impt than ur job or money.
2 Jan 09:03 - hp Ivan: Everything is fake
2 Jan 09:03 - hp Ivan: The world is fake
2 Jan 09:04 - hp Czy: Wow poor ivan...
2 Jan 09:05 - hp Ivan: Yup I'm poor
2 Jan 09:05 - hp Ivan: No money now
2 Jan 09:06 - hp Ivan: Can I borrow 1k from u?
2 Jan 09:06 - hp Czy: Sure if u sign black and white contract with interest üòÑ
2 Jan 09:07 - hp Hongxin: CZY, it's not fake. It's trying to be positive.
2 Jan 09:07 - hp Czy: Oh ok... be more positive and keep ur worries away till they burn u then
2 Jan 09:08 - hp Ivan: Why need interest?
2 Jan 09:09 - hp Ivan: U scared I become john min?
2 Jan 09:09 - Victor Cheong: Do not mention that name
2 Jan 09:09 - hp Ivan: Haha
2 Jan 09:09 - hp Czy: No, to be fair to the money lender
2 Jan 09:09 - hp Ivan: U know who
2 Jan 09:09 - hp Czy: Else might as well i give u the money
2 Jan 09:09 - hp Ivan: Hmm interest = fair?
2 Jan 09:10 - hp Czy: Ask a bank if interest is unfair and what is a loan
2 Jan 09:10 - hp Ivan: But u not bank
2 Jan 09:10 - hp Ivan: U are a friend
2 Jan 09:10 - hp Czy: Well technically u are getting a loan frm me
2 Jan 09:10 - hp Ivan: But then u still are a friend
2 Jan 09:11 - hp Ivan: Isn't a friend suppose to help one another?
2 Jan 09:11 - hp Czy: Thats borrow, if u ask if i can give u 1k
2 Jan 09:11 - hp Ivan: Like how Vic helps hx during the wedding?
2 Jan 09:11 - hp Czy: Thats no interest then
2 Jan 09:11 - Victor Cheong: ÈÇ£‰∏™ÊòØË¢´ÈÄºÂæó
2 Jan 09:12 - hp Ivan: But borrow why need interest? Just help me for a while...then I return u once I have the money
2 Jan 09:12 - hp Ivan: No need to give
2 Jan 09:12 - hp Hongxin: Vic didn't lend me any money le.
2 Jan 09:12 - hp Czy: Give is no interest burrow will have, of course if the sum is insinificant
2 Jan 09:12 - hp Czy: Recording of interest is pointless
2 Jan 09:12 - hp Ivan: But I lend hx money for his wedding
2 Jan 09:13 - hp Ivan: For one night using standard chartered card
2 Jan 09:13 - hp Ivan: I also never charge interest
2 Jan 09:13 - hp Ivan: And he returned me the next day
2 Jan 09:14 - hp Czy: That is up to individual
2 Jan 09:14 - Victor Cheong: Hx = Â•ΩÂÖ¨Ê∞ë
2 Jan 09:14 - hp Czy: I like to go by how the bank functions
2 Jan 09:14 - hp Ivan: Hahaha ok
2 Jan 09:14 - hp Ivan: Then bank doesn't complain about religions
2 Jan 09:15 - hp Czy: Sorry thats another matter
2 Jan 09:15 - hp Czy: If u dont want to hear abt religions
2 Jan 09:15 - hp Czy: I can leave this chat
2 Jan 09:15 - hp Czy: Its cause people complained that i keep leaving chats that i bother to even stay on
2 Jan 09:15 - hp Ivan: I just saying bank doesn't complain..I love to hear about your views on religions
2 Jan 09:16 - Victor Cheong: Democratic group this is
2 Jan 09:16 - Victor Cheong: Freedom of speech allowed here
2 Jan 09:16 - hp Czy: Lol ur love sounds vulgar, well gd day to u ivan üòâ
2 Jan 09:16 - hp Ivan: Vulgar?
2 Jan 09:17 - hp Hongxin: Yeah cZY, we need alternative views.
2 Jan 09:17 - hp Czy: Need dictionary? Or i spell is wrng again?
2 Jan 09:17 - hp Ivan: Vulgar: making explicit and offensive reference to sex or bodily functions; coarse and rude.
2 Jan 09:17 - hp Ivan: From dictionary
2 Jan 09:18 - hp Czy: Oh i got the spelling right
2 Jan 09:18 - hp Czy: Thanks
2 Jan 09:18 - hp Ivan: I love u..doesn't seem vulgar to me
2 Jan 09:18 - hp Ivan: You mean sarcastic?
2 Jan 09:18 - hp Czy: Well its up to individual and situations to feel what each individual word sounds like at a given time
2 Jan 09:19 - hp Ivan: Ok
2 Jan 09:20 - hp Czy: Lol... no thanks. Ur welcome
2 Jan 09:20 - hp Ivan: But anyways I'm really honest and I meant its good to have different views on certain matters
2 Jan 09:21 - hp Czy: That depends
2 Jan 09:22 - hp Ivan: But u really can give me 1k?
2 Jan 09:22 - hp Czy: Yea sure, if u need it urgently, y not?
2 Jan 09:22 - hp Hongxin: Ok... Thanks to a wonderful start to our day!
2 Jan 09:23 - hp Ivan: Give = no return
2 Jan 09:23 - hp Czy: Yea
2 Jan 09:23 - GZ: I can give u 1.1k ivan
2 Jan 09:24 - hp Hongxin: That's not give.
That's donation.
2 Jan 09:24 - hp Hongxin: Wah.. I'm not joining in the fight to donate for Keefer's milk powder.
2 Jan 09:24 - GZ: Why...
2 Jan 09:24 - GZ: Its for a better clause
2 Jan 09:25 - Victor Cheong: I don't donate to babies that vomit on me
2 Jan 09:25 - hp Czy: I can spare that 1k if u needed it for something impt. Lets say a fren got cancer and need treatment imediately and u know they cant pay u back
2 Jan 09:25 - hp Czy: Would u give the 1 k or lend the 1k with interest?
2 Jan 09:27 - hp Czy: I would rather give the 1k than have a retribution of regret by giving more stress to the already helpless
2 Jan 09:29 - Victor Cheong: And if that person is...He who shall not be named?
2 Jan 09:29 - hp Czy: Dont know how ivan thinks but his comments and questions is always so weird... or is that my answers are all weird that no one could have thought of such simple stuff?
2 Jan 09:30 - hp Czy: Vic are u brainless?
2 Jan 09:30 - hp Czy: Ur question is even more dumb than ivan... no wonder u piss gals off...
2 Jan 09:31 - hp Czy: If someone lends money from u and then runs off with it betraying ur trust
2 Jan 09:31 - hp Czy: Would u still give him money??
2 Jan 09:32 - hp Czy: Please ask urself the question before asking in the chat, makes u look really low iq...
2 Jan 09:32 - Victor Cheong: Of course not but I was referring to say if he got cancer and repents and asks for 1k again.
2 Jan 09:32 - hp Czy: How would u trust
2 Jan 09:32 - hp Czy: He tepent
2 Jan 09:32 - hp Czy: Repent
2 Jan 09:32 - Victor Cheong: It's an assumption.
2 Jan 09:33 - hp Czy: If u ever heard of this sentence
2 Jan 09:33 - hp Czy: "Dont assume"
2 Jan 09:33 - hp Czy: U wont be saying that
2 Jan 09:35 - hp Czy: Beter stop on ur questions before ur iq gets even lower.... did u do too much accounts? I heard it kind of lower people's ability to think...
2 Jan 09:40 - 2 Cy: Early morning kanna flooded liao..
2 Jan 09:42 - 2 Cy: I lend my fren 5k no interest.. And he's repaying back slowly la... It's really depend on how much trust u know in that person... * pls don't borrow money from me as I'm still broke without that 5k haha
2 Jan 09:43 - hp Czy: Tats why i say its up to individual mahz
2 Jan 09:43 - hp Hongxin: Who's that friend man? Borrow for what?
2 Jan 09:43 - hp Czy: I would rather give the 5k if i could spare it though i cant lol
2 Jan 09:46 - 2 Cy: It's my biz partner, it's not like I lend him knowing the fact that I know he won't run away la... Cos I always believe if money can solve a problem, then it's not a big issue.. It's more of things money that can't solve
2 Jan 09:48 - hp Czy: For me lending money to frenz is a bad thing, if the fren is honest, its very stressful for him if he cant pay u back, if the fren is not honest, u will be trying to get the money back after getting conned, problem is u never will and u would have hold the grudge for a long time. But whats the point of the grudge being held in? Nothing changes the fact that u are already betrayed and the money wont come back to u. So why not make do without evee having the thghts of geting back the money u spare out?
2 Jan 09:50 - hp Czy: Its like donation, in a way yes but more like just helping out a fren that u trust in a way that u wont taint ur heart with pointless stuff
2 Jan 09:55 - hp Ivan: So can I get a donation??
2 Jan 09:56 - hp Ivan: Haha I think nvm..I get from bank better...even though they charge interest..
2 Jan 09:59 - 2 Cy: Aiya.. Whatever it is.. It's up to the individual how he manages the money. Even if there's black and white, it also doesn't mean the person can pay back u know.. It just mean u have some receivables..

In corporate world.. Ppl invest / loan the company thousands of $$ and yet company can close down.. They also suck thumb.. Just my thoughts =p.. 

Shall get back to work haha
2 Jan 10:00 - hp Czy: Yea its just a way to press charges
2 Jan 10:10 - Victor Cheong: Press charges also no use if the company is bankrupt
2 Jan 10:23 - hp Czy: Yea but ar least u got something to use to press charge against
2 Jan 10:24 - hp Czy: Or u havnt learn ur lesson yet vic?
2 Jan 10:25 - Victor Cheong: If u aren't going to get anything back and u know that, don't press. Charges
2 Jan 10:25 - Victor Cheong: Legal fees aren't free u know?
2 Jan 10:25 - Victor Cheong: Even registering the complain to the courts costs money
2 Jan 10:25 - Victor Cheong: This is based on the assumption that the guy really has 0 cash and assets
2 Jan 11:35 - hp Czy: I would be happy knowing the person is in bankruptcy status if i only have to lose what i lend him
2 Jan 11:37 - hp Czy: I would want him to suffer the mental torture of being a lesser human, and that he could never own any asset and that all his money cant be his and that if he has a family his family have to own all the assets that if one day the family decides to throw him out, he becomes a begger hmless on the street
2 Jan 11:38 - hp Czy: I aint a holy one, i feel joy and estacy looking at the suffering of the ones i detest
2 Jan 11:40 - hp Czy: Especially mental suffering, it gives excitement
2 Jan 11:42 - hp Czy: But well, people in religions wanting to be good* wont understand that revenge taste bitter sweet, just like dark chocolates

8 Jan 13:48 - hp Czy: Erm ok, die in peace sounds nicer
8 Jan 13:58 - hp Czy: Religion or whatsoever.... sure, they can apply for the thousands of years that earth or universe existed, what about billions of years before this universe ever existed, or trillion of yrs after this universe cease to exist... in the end, u are u, u live for what u feel u should be doing and living for in the given instance that u are able to. Whether it is for good, for god, for evil, for fun. As long u deem it worth living for, u can, yet please dont try to inflict ur ideas upon others or brainwash them cause they have thier own lifes, no matter if they are cripple, dieing, just born... they still have their own rights not to be brainwashed
8 Jan 14:00 - hp Czy: I see sons and daughters of christians all auto become christians, same as muslims and buddhist... feels sad for the one who entered this world and before understanding anything, already branded with a tatoo
8 Jan 14:05 - Victor Cheong: Well technically they are called Christians since they are baptised by their parents
8 Jan 14:05 - Victor Cheong: But whether they follow the ways is another thing
8 Jan 14:05 - hp Czy: Erm
8 Jan 14:05 - Victor Cheong: If they choose not to follow when they are older also lan lan
8 Jan 14:05 - hp Czy: Yea
8 Jan 14:06 - hp Czy: But
8 Jan 14:06 - hp Czy: Already branded
8 Jan 14:06 - Victor Cheong: Lol u make them sound like cattle
8 Jan 14:07 - hp Czy: Hmmm, i give a evil example la, cant think of a gd one that leaves a impact
8 Jan 14:08 - hp Czy: Lets say a religion evil one, says tat all girls are to be made non virgin at child birth and all boys are to have thier penis skin all removed
8 Jan 14:09 - hp Czy: How is that person's will going to be of any choice when young????
8 Jan 14:09 - hp Czy: Its the same as christian kids
8 Jan 14:10 - hp Czy: Physical dmg is permanent, so is time that is used upon something
8 Jan 14:11 - hp Czy: U know how to differenciate a sgrean and a non sgrean? When did u start wrk after uni?? Tats how... 2 yr of ns as a branding. Do u have a choice? No...u dont..
8 Jan 14:13 - hp Czy: Spending all ur time in church listening to teachings which u have no idea how to differenciate whether its true or fake? Whether it is for selfish benefits or greater gd?
8 Jan 14:15 - hp Czy: Sad to say vic... we are all cattles, and ur son and daughters will be one too, its just how many brands they have before they get to have thier choices that it differs from one another. Well, some say, the more the merrier... i would rather not though...
8 Jan 14:20 - Victor Cheong: When young of course they will have no choice but as they grow older and finally get a mind of their own
8 Jan 14:20 - Victor Cheong: They can decide
8 Jan 14:21 - Victor Cheong: A lot of young christian kids don't follow the ways after they hit secondary school
8 Jan 14:21 - hp Czy: Erm well after being branded
8 Jan 14:21 - Victor Cheong: That's why more brain washing is needed
8 Jan 14:21 - hp Czy: Or tatoo
8 Jan 14:21 - hp Czy: No matter how u wash or try to remove
8 Jan 14:21 - hp Czy: It leaves a mark
8 Jan 14:39 - Liu Xuan: Cattle dun think, no memory, dun write, dun preserve history, while human do, and search for ancient history, explore universe, and even send spaceship to other planet, to look for an answer to human being, and life, still nobody knows how universe is created, Big Bang? Evolution or design? ...
8 Jan 14:42 - hp Czy: .... cattles do think, have to correct u on this... and they do have memory even if its less intelligent than humans. And by saying we are all cattles, its an illustriation following vic, as that he means being branded make us sound like cattles, not that we are literally one
8 Jan 14:44 - hp Czy: Please do not belittle other animals just cause humam are more intelligent, pigs are very intelligent beings thats similar to a kid, we are eating them as food all year long
8 Jan 14:44 - Victor Cheong: Who could resist bacon?
8 Jan 14:44 - hp Czy: Yea i cant
8 Jan 14:46 - hp Czy: Well, bacon is so freaking good... the least u can do to respect the provider is to finish it with gratitude lol
8 Jan 15:06 - Liu Xuan: Well then, Will one cattle belittle another cattle? if a cattle is branded chew's, will another cattle belittle him becuz he is a gambang labelled? Haha
8 Jan 15:08 - hp Czy: No cattle will want to be branded either way, its not about them belittle one another...
8 Jan 15:08 - hp Czy: Lol...
8 Jan 15:10 - hp Czy: Well, if someone comes over to u when u are born and put a tatoo on u, would u want that?
8 Jan 15:14 - Liu Xuan: You will be used to that jus like a birth mark, I think
8 Jan 15:18 - hp Czy: Lol after someone get raped, yrs later, would have moved on too
8 Jan 15:24 - Liu Xuan: Btw, when compare I think it's better to compare Apple with Apple, pear with pear, in bible there is a lot of parables using animals, here is an example:
Four things on earth are small,
but they are exceedingly wise:
the ants are a people not strong,
yet they provide their food in the summer;
the rock badgers are a people not mighty,
yet they make their homes in the cliffs;
the locusts have no king,
yet all of them march in rank;
the lizard you can take in your hands,
yet it is in kings' palaces.     
Proverb 30:24-28
8 Jan 15:27 - Liu Xuan: Up then? It's hard to forgive, but to forgive is to move on. Be grateful that The earth is still spinning, he/she is get raped but still have life,
8 Jan 15:28 - hp Czy: Lol... brainwashed badly
8 Jan 15:31 - Liu Xuan: The law/society has its own justification, if no one/ no law  speaks up for the victim then it will be worse
8 Jan 15:32 - hp Czy: I should promote christians to the rapists in india, then there wont be any problems, since after geting raped the laws help the rapers and the christians is grateful for being alife
8 Jan 15:36 - hp Czy: What a wonderfull world, the indian teens and children would be thanking christians for being thier substitute, no wonder theres this selfless saying: "Êàë‰∏çÂÖ•Âú∞Âüü,Ë∞ÅÂÖ•Âú∞Âüü?" I guess christians by thier teachings would be grateful for the experience cause after it happens they will thank god for it?
8 Jan 15:45 - hp Czy: Oh i just remb a joke... a atheist doctor asking a christian, "why are u here? U dont need medicine since you dont believe in science, please just go do ur prayers." Lol!
8 Jan 15:46 - hp Hongxin: Everything happens for a reason.
But we won't intentionally let ourselves be hurt or hurt others.
8 Jan 15:46 - hp Hongxin: As Christians, we believe everything is from God. He is the creator of all things and that includes medicine.
8 Jan 15:48 - hp Czy: Lol medicine is science
8 Jan 15:49 - hp Czy: Its created by humans
8 Jan 15:49 - hp Czy: If u say the incredients of the medicine then ok we can leave it ur way
8 Jan 15:50 - hp Czy: But then, try eating the ingredients, by urself lol
8 Jan 15:52 - hp Czy: And please say everything happens for a reason that is gods will, when u ended up captured by some psycopath, tear ur daughter's skin by a peeler, morfin the brain till she feels little pain, and tear one strain of her muscle fibre infront of u every single time she is awake
8 Jan 15:52 - hp Czy: Right infront of u
8 Jan 15:56 - hp Czy: And the psycopath tells u, "hey, this is gods will, every min you are alife, i will take into account and tear away 1 of her muscle fibre". He prevents u to sucide from whatever method, not even holding ur breath, cause u are already under a resporitory support system.
8 Jan 15:58 - hp Czy: And so, at the end of all of it, ur daughter died, u couldnt save her, the psycopath cont move on to another target.
8 Jan 15:59 - hp Czy: U are alive, cause u are able to watch ur daughter die a cruel death, so tell me, how would u have gratitude when that happens?
8 Jan 16:01 - hp Hongxin: I'll make sure the psychopath is stopped.
But cannot deny God.
8 Jan 16:02 - hp Hongxin: But all intelligence comes from God. He allow the invention of the medicine to happen.
8 Jan 16:04 - hp Czy: Lol but do u have gratituse that the psycopath killed ur daughter
8 Jan 16:05 - hp Czy: In this way?
8 Jan 16:05 - hp Czy: Why deny when u have gratitude for it?
8 Jan 16:06 - hp Czy: And the psycopath have already disappeared out of ur reach, he may just die somewhere or happily took too much drug till die
8 Jan 16:07 - hp Czy: U will nver know, only thing u know, is ur experience.
8 Jan 16:09 - hp Czy: After that, ur wife went mad and died in the mental hosipital after afew years due to severe depression. The experience* is what is left, when ur daughter is dieing infront of u, will u be thanking god or praying for people to save her?
8 Jan 16:10 - hp Czy: Lol...
8 Jan 16:14 - hp Czy: I would be cursing god or whatever higher being that i believed in for this tragedy. Lol
8 Jan 16:17 - hp Czy: Btw, if i tell u the psycopath, had a similar tragedy and had gone mad, he just wanted to have someone that can understand him and thats why he prayed to god and the ans he thght of is doing this to you
8 Jan 16:19 - hp Czy: Will u have gratitude that he let you understand his grief? Under god's will?
8 Jan 16:22 - Victor Cheong: IMG-20150108-WA0003.jpg (file attached)
8 Jan 16:25 - hp Czy: I would think u better have the idea that in this world, there is not just god's will, else sooner or later u wont be able to differenciate good from evil cause when one is too devoted to another, in the name of the another, anyone can manipulate u to thier will.
8 Jan 16:27 - hp Czy: Vic
8 Jan 16:27 - hp Czy: Believe in ur god
8 Jan 16:27 - hp Czy: And walk atraight through 5 heavy traffic

8 Jan 16:36 - hp Czy: If i say all this or anyone says all this
8 Jan 16:36 - hp Czy: Isnt he or she god?
8 Jan 16:44 - hp Czy: Hmmm, well, if i am able to convince people that i am god... i guess i would be one... since they believe in it
8 Jan 16:57 - hp Czy: Lol, i get the idea of how christianity works, first is the will of believe by some, and there theres one willing to be god
8 Jan 16:57 - hp Czy: And then a religion would be formed by bringing more people
8 Jan 16:57 - hp Czy: To believe in the one willing to be believed in by the ones who have the will to believe
8 Jan 16:58 - hp Czy: Hahahaaha... i can go some village start my own religion
8 Jan 17:03 - Victor Cheong: U probably can. Religion is abt faith after all
8 Jan 17:03 - hp Czy: Yelp hahaha
8 Jan 17:03 - Victor Cheong: If u can convince /con /fake /prove to others pple..It will work
8 Jan 17:04 - hp Czy: Not for buddhism though
8 Jan 17:04 - hp Czy: But ya for those that have a god, lol
8 Jan 17:04 - Victor Cheong: It's like in those movies where those super technological tyrants go to a backward world where their technology makes it seems they are gods
8 Jan 17:04 - Victor Cheong: And ta da hoodwinked the population
8 Jan 17:04 - hp Czy: Yelp hahahhaa
8 Jan 17:05 - hp Czy: Damn... think now everytime i see a christian i will have to control myself not to grin too much
8 Jan 17:08 - hp Czy: I guess some people is willing to believe in a religion cause they feel better, cause without a religion, u have no faith about what happens after u die, its like blindly believing in an assurance
8 Jan 17:09 - Victor Cheong: Try not to grin too much when u see hx noelle lx and I ok?
8 Jan 17:09 - hp Czy: Lol i will try
8 Jan 17:10 - hp Czy: Its not cause i feel u guys are stupid, its just me feeling gd cause i have more courage to accept the unknown than to make myself believe something to feel better
8 Jan 17:16 - Victor Cheong: Sorry for being stupid lorrrr
8 Jan 17:16 - hp Czy: Lol
8 Jan 17:16 - hp Czy: Tats u say one

8 Jan 17:53 - Victor Cheong: To know thy enemy must infiltrate them u know?
8 Jan 17:58 - hp Czy: Nahz
8 Jan 17:59 - hp Czy: If i go there and tell them i am god
8 Jan 17:59 - hp Czy: Then what?
8 Jan 17:59 - hp Czy: Will they pray to me?
8 Jan 17:59 - 4/1 EdwarD: Pray la
8 Jan 17:59 - 4/1 EdwarD: Come
8 Jan 18:02 - hp Czy: Hahaha then i shouldnt go to then
8 Jan 18:02 - hp Czy: They just pray to me can le, i am everywhere
8 Jan 19:09 - Liu Xuan: When we write God to refer to the one and only supreme God, we use capital letter for the first letter, to show our respect and fear, the way you spell god is not the way we call on our one and only God, becuz technically you are not the God who is in control of everything, who is everywhere, all knowing , and almighty. Even if you claim to be so, will you be submissive enough and willing to die on the cross for every human being's sin? And will you rise from dead 3 days after and show to ppl your wounds in hand and feet, and open their minds to understand Scripture from Law of Moses to Prophet of Psalms.
8 Jan 19:10 - hp Czy: I will is all is made believed
8 Jan 19:11 - hp Czy: Are u at the place to witness everything?
8 Jan 19:11 - hp Czy: Who here can hands up and say they did?

8 Jan 19:12 - hp Czy: How is anyone able to proof me wrong when i say i did it in a previous life?
8 Jan 19:13 - hp Czy: Hahahaha, anyone can say anything, if i believe a cubic meter of air is God, keep it in a bottle and pray to it everyday, suddenly u find another few people doing the same thing
8 Jan 19:13 - 4/1 EdwarD: Where is Muhammad
8 Jan 19:14 - hp Czy: That  bottle of air have became God
8 Jan 19:14 - hp Czy: Hahahah
8 Jan 19:15 - 4/1 EdwarD: God is mighty
8 Jan 19:15 - 4/1 EdwarD: So is Allah
8 Jan 19:19 - hp Czy: Hahahaha yea

The Christians that are not Catholics are called Protestants and there's a lot of social and historical reasons how Protestantism broke away from Catholicism and he Protestant movement came abt in the past.

Society became organized around two principles: that males shall dominate females and that elders shall dominate the young (Kim 1993). Growing old in Korea had advantages for both women and men, for age was respected. According to this perspective, women were often self-assertive and highly valued, as the family finance managers, decisionmakers in family matters, and educators of children¬†

12 Jan 13:41 - hp Czy: Its a fking natural resource area kept in the ground
12 Jan 13:42 - Victor Cheong: It's not the inventions it's the use mankind uses that harms the earth
12 Jan 13:43 - hp Czy: Zzzzz
12 Jan 13:43 - hp Czy: Lets give u afew points
12 Jan 13:43 - hp Czy: 1) humans have gd and bad and the mad
12 Jan 13:44 - hp Czy: 2) u can create a switch that anyone can press to destroy earth
12 Jan 13:44 - hp Czy: 3) only u is able to create it
12 Jan 13:44 - hp Czy: Will u create it?
12 Jan 13:46 - hp Czy: 4) tat switch can supply the whole human race infinite energy, though wastes are indisposible
12 Jan 13:46 - hp Czy: So? Will u create it? I wont
12 Jan 13:46 - hp Ivan: üò∑
12 Jan 13:52 - Victor Cheong: U assume that they knew the wastes were in disposable
12 Jan 13:53 - Victor Cheong: Sometimes Humans create things without fully understanding the consequences
12 Jan 13:53 - hp Czy: Lol...
12 Jan 13:54 - hp Czy: Thats why theres God rite?
12 Jan 13:54 - hp Czy: To forgive thier sins
12 Jan 13:54 - hp Czy: Facepalm and hahahhahahahahahaha
12 Jan 14:48 - Victor Cheong: God is there for humans to have faith
12 Jan 14:49 - hp Czy: Why woulf u need God to have faith in urself??
12 Jan 14:49 - hp Czy: And whats those confession sessions for?
12 Jan 14:50 - Victor Cheong: Anyway regarding the hell hole in Russia, they didn't do any research on the depth or size of it before deciding to use explosives to blow it up
12 Jan 14:50 - hp Czy: Yea doesnt matter
12 Jan 14:51 - hp Czy: They can set fire to it
12 Jan 14:51 - hp Czy: It will blow up too
12 Jan 14:51 - Victor Cheong: It shows humans are quite an impulsive bunch
12 Jan 14:51 - hp Czy: No
12 Jan 14:51 - hp Czy: Its shows humans nver learn
12 Jan 14:51 - Victor Cheong: If proper research was done, they MIGHT have known otherwise
12 Jan 14:52 - hp Czy: They never ever think that humans that are evil will use it as a weapon
12 Jan 14:53 - hp Czy: They nver thght that gd humans can become evil
12 Jan 14:53 - hp Czy: And good humans can become mad
12 Jan 14:53 - hp Czy: They only know one thing
12 Jan 14:53 - Victor Cheong: Frankly speaking it's all abt greed
12 Jan 14:53 - hp Czy: They are fking capable of making the nuclear materials and they did
12 Jan 14:54 - hp Czy: And they have thier God  to forgive them when something bad happens
12 Jan 14:54 - Victor Cheong: That and currently experimenting with anti matter in their science base in America lol
12 Jan 14:54 - hp Czy: Cause everything happens for a reason and that is God'S intention
12 Jan 14:55 - Victor Cheong: Which there was an article last year there was a chance that an accident would wipe out the early
12 Jan 14:55 - Victor Cheong: Earth
12 Jan 14:55 - hp Czy: That would be nice
12 Jan 14:55 - Victor Cheong: Didn't know u so religious zy
12 Jan 14:55 - Victor Cheong: Can start preaching abt god liao
12 Jan 14:55 - hp Czy: Erm wrng
12 Jan 14:56 - hp Czy: I am learning from the quotes of hx u and noelle
12 Jan 14:56 - hp Czy: If u 3 are a religion then yea
12 Jan 14:58 - hp Czy: But well, next time someone's son or daughter died, if hes a christian, i will console him or her with "its God intention that ur son or daughter died, be glad that ur son or daughter died"
12 Jan 14:59 - Victor Cheong: We will also add at least he's not suffering anymore
12 Jan 14:59 - Victor Cheong: If the person was suffering from a long term illness why not?
12 Jan 14:59 - hp Czy: Vic u suffering?
12 Jan 14:59 - hp Czy: From long term illness?
12 Jan 14:59 - hp Czy: Please go die
12 Jan 15:00 - Victor Cheong: All in good time
12 Jan 15:00 - hp Czy: So i can console ur mum
12 Jan 15:00 - hp Czy: With that
12 Jan 15:00 - hp Czy: Lol die faster
12 Jan 15:00 - hp Czy: Cant wait to say those words
12 Jan 15:00 - Victor Cheong: There was a person in my church that died recently after 7 years of being in a coma
12 Jan 15:00 - Victor Cheong: And that's what the pastor said
12 Jan 15:01 - Victor Cheong: Though we do not know the Lord's will in taking her away, we are glad that she is no longer suffering in pain
12 Jan 15:01 - hp Czy: Thats extreme case
12 Jan 15:01 - hp Czy: U think the person in coma is not God's will?
12 Jan 15:01 - Victor Cheong: We are but mere mortals
12 Jan 15:02 - Victor Cheong: How are we to know God's will?
12 Jan 15:01 - hp Czy: Why should he suffer 7yrs in comma?
12 Jan 15:02 - hp Czy: Hmm feels that i can do anything to a christian and they say its God's will
12 Jan 15:03 - Victor Cheong: She*
12 Jan 15:03 - Victor Cheong: And come on its not religion that's erasing traditional values as well
12 Jan 15:03 - hp Czy: If u put the logic that is up till now into use
12 Jan 15:03 - hp Czy: I most probably can right?
12 Jan 15:04 - Victor Cheong: U do know it's thanks to the spread of English as the dominant language in the world that many languages and values are also being erased?
12 Jan 15:04 - hp Czy: I dont really care abt that
12 Jan 15:05 - hp Czy: They dont ask people to only study english
12 Jan 15:05 - Victor Cheong: Technically the original topic here was abt traditional values and wives remember?
12 Jan 15:05 - hp Czy: But christians only believe in God
12 Jan 15:05 - hp Czy: Thats the main problem
12 Jan 15:05 - Victor Cheong: But if the world's main language is English, where trade and commerce and business is all done in English
12 Jan 15:05 - hp Czy: *Only
12 Jan 15:05 - hp Czy: It doesnt matter vic
12 Jan 15:06 - Victor Cheong: Does it not serve an a greater incentive for pple to learn the language?
12 Jan 15:06 - hp Czy: No one restricts u from learnimg whatever languagw
12 Jan 15:06 - hp Czy: U wan
12 Jan 15:06 - Victor Cheong: At the cost of their own?
12 Jan 15:06 - hp Czy: It nver force u
12 Jan 15:06 - hp Czy: But God force u
12 Jan 15:06 - hp Czy: I learn singing
12 Jan 15:06 - Victor Cheong: But imaginary person will be disadvantaged if he doesn't learn the language
12 Jan 15:07 - Victor Cheong: And come on...English was ard long before g
Christianity became a major religion
12 Jan 15:15 - hp Czy: Erm vic
12 Jan 15:16 - hp Czy: Ur statement is really lame
12 Jan 15:16 - hp Czy: There is a difference, a major one, between being forced or restricted
12 Jan 15:16 - hp Czy: Or being affected
12 Jan 15:17 - hp Czy: U can be restricted from going out of prison by prison bars and wardens
12 Jan 15:18 - hp Czy: But if they are only there but does not restrict u
12 Jan 15:18 - hp Czy: U can still open the gate and walk out
12 Jan 15:18 - hp Czy: Maybe there is hordes of zombies
12 Jan 15:20 - Victor Cheong: It was English that helped spread Christianity not the other way around
12 Jan 15:20 - Victor Cheong: Just because Henry 8th wanted to marry another woman.
12 Jan 15:21 - hp Czy: Haiz
12 Jan 15:21 - hp Czy: Like i said
12 Jan 15:22 - hp Czy: I dont care
12 Jan 15:22 - hp Czy: The impt part is the restriction and forcing
12 Jan 15:22 - hp Czy: Not the spreading
12 Jan 15:23 - Victor Cheong: Then don't be a christian lah no one's forcing u to be one
12 Jan 15:23 - hp Czy: I wouldnt mind if u tell me christians can believe in other Gods such as allah and buddah
12 Jan 15:23 - Victor Cheong: Likewise don't force Christians to believe otherwise
12 Jan 15:23 - hp Czy: Zzz
12 Jan 15:24 - hp Czy: If christians can do that, i dont even mind if the whole world is christians
12 Jan 15:24 - Victor Cheong: All religions are the same. Wanting to spread their words
12 Jan 15:25 - hp Czy: Nope
12 Jan 15:25 - Victor Cheong: Demographics u know? No new recruits = old ones die and no replacements
12 Jan 15:25 - hp Czy: Buddhist doesnt
12 Jan 15:25 - Victor Cheong: =No religion left
12 Jan 15:26 - hp Czy: They seclude themself to the fking temples in the mountains
12 Jan 15:26 - hp Czy: They help people but dont need u to believe in them
12 Jan 15:27 - hp Czy: Infact, they look up to mother thearesa as a godly being that is to be look up to
12 Jan 15:28 - hp Czy: And they believe that Christian's God exists, just they believe every other religion's god exists too
12 Jan 15:29 - hp Czy: The only 2 things they do is not to harm others in whaterever way they can and to help others in watevwr way they can
12 Jan 15:30 - hp Czy: Problem is, the level that they can do
12 Jan 15:30 - hp Czy: One more thing is, they always in the lugi end cause this world isnt all buddhist so people can just take advNtage of them
12 Jan 15:31 - hp Czy: Imo, its a pretty lugi believe when compare to christians
12 Jan 15:31 - hp Czy: Too selfless
12 Jan 15:32 - Victor Cheong: Christians also help pple u know?  We don't forcibly ask them to convert
12 Jan 15:32 - hp Czy: No
12 Jan 15:32 - Victor Cheong: Barring the middle ages where they launched crusades
12 Jan 15:32 - hp Czy: U force people to believe in only God
12 Jan 15:33 - hp Czy: By peer pressures
12 Jan 15:33 - hp Czy: And marriagw
12 Jan 15:33 - Victor Cheong: If they ask abt it
12 Jan 15:33 - hp Czy: And watevwr shit
12 Jan 15:33 - Victor Cheong: We don't March into temples and what not to say convert or die etc
12 Jan 15:33 - hp Czy: Nope...
12 Jan 15:33 - hp Czy: Lets say 100 of ur frens
12 Jan 15:33 - hp Czy: All is christians
12 Jan 15:34 - Victor Cheong: U can ask ed. Pretty sure his gf doesn't force him to believe in Christianity either
12 Jan 15:34 - hp Czy: And they meet up in chrich and activities every day
12 Jan 15:34 - hp Czy: U are the odd one out
12 Jan 15:34 - hp Czy: What next? The peer pressure is super high
12 Jan 15:34 - Victor Cheong: Then do different things lah.
12 Jan 15:34 - hp Czy: No christian will ever say they wanna force u
12 Jan 15:35 - Victor Cheong: My whole cousins family are Christians
12 Jan 15:35 - hp Czy: They only ever ask u come to church
12 Jan 15:35 - hp Czy: Which u guys did ask me
12 Jan 15:35 - Victor Cheong: That time I wasn't a Christian and if they had event I just say I don't go
12 Jan 15:35 - hp Czy: And then turns out if i did
12 Jan 15:35 - Victor Cheong: Then I will plan other things
12 Jan 15:35 - hp Czy: I walk into a trap of peer pressure
12 Jan 15:36 - hp Czy: U sounds like u just gave in to peer pressure
12 Jan 15:36 - Victor Cheong: Pple of like mindedness will stick together. U will most likely find other non christian friends to hang out with
12 Jan 15:36 - hp Czy: And brain washing

28 Jan 15:54 - hp Czy: Hmmm lol
30 Jan 08:30 - hp Hongxin: Good medical advice from the Jewish sages of old...  
1. F***ing once a week is good for your health, but it's harmful if done every day. 
2. F***ing relaxes your mind and body. 
3. F***ing refreshes you. 
4. After F***ing, don‚Äôt eat too much; go for more liquids. 
5. Try F***ing in bed 'cause it can save you valuable energy.
6. F***ing can even reduce your cholesterol levels.
SO, REMEMBER...
 Fasting... Is good for your health
And may God cleanse your dirty mind...
30 Jan 08:31 - hp Czy: No dirty mind where will have humans?

4 Feb 17:19 - hp Czy: Its a mechanic that only humans have that wins alot of atuff, the ability to stand on 2 legs
4 Feb 17:20 - hp Czy: Alot of people dun realize how powerful 1 is when they stand on 2 legs
4 Feb 17:21 - hp Czy: Instead of moving on 4, 2 for movement and 2 for striking or manuvability or balancing or even hanging or grabing atuffs, not to mention tools
4 Feb 17:25 - hp Ivan: But eventually everyone can adapt..it's just whether how soon

18 Feb 08:41 - hp Hongxin: Not all churches or male Christians are like those U met in City Harvest who attends church with the wrong intentions.

Victor joined not because of girls. He wasn't in any cell at the beginning.
Those guys U met in City Harvest, their intentions are outright clear to jio girls based on what u told us.
18 Feb 08:42 - hp Hongxin: I was the one who asked victor to join a cell group if I remember correctly because he was nua in the beginning.

18 Feb 08:59 - Victor Cheong: Aww come on...pple who go to church exclusively to chase girls / guys are pretty bastard-ish

18 Feb 08:59 - Victor Cheong: Who will want such pple?
18 Feb 09:00 - hp Czy: I will, y not? U mean to tell me they are of a lower class just cause of that?

18 Feb 09:01 - Victor Cheong: Ah ok then that's that
18 Feb 09:02 - hp Czy: Its those that hide thier intention while doing something then those are vypocrites
18 Feb 09:02 - Victor Cheong: True
18 Feb 09:02 - hp Czy: Texhnically since u said u only go chruxh to pray, if u get a gal there... u are a hypocrite, so erm... try not to label urself as that
18 Feb 09:03 - Victor Cheong: I said I don't go to church ONLY to chase girls
18 Feb 09:03 - Victor Cheong: So its like 70% pray and 30% girls kinda equation
18 Feb 09:04 - Victor Cheong: 30% social interactions. That sounds better
18 Feb 09:03 - hp Czy: Else u gona have to exclude a whole bunch of gals...
18 Feb 09:03 - hp Czy: Can i just tilt it?
18 Feb 09:04 - hp Czy: Ist wrng?
18 Feb 09:04 - hp Hongxin: So U go to school and U get a girl means U only go to Sch to jio girls?
18 Feb 09:04 - hp Czy: 90% jio gals 10 % study
18 Feb 09:04 - hp Czy: Ist wrng?
18 Feb 09:04 - hp Czy: I still study
18 Feb 09:04 - hp Hongxin: The primary reason to go sch must still be study
18 Feb 09:04 - hp Czy: Does the sch reject me for going?
18 Feb 09:05 - hp Czy: Whats the standard %.?
18 Feb 09:05 - hp Czy: Lets say i get over that %
18 Feb 09:05 - hp Czy: Do i get kicked out?
18 Feb 09:06 - hp Czy: I nver said u are!!!
18 Feb 09:06 - hp Czy: I saying u should try!!
18 Feb 09:07 - hp Czy: Before y are 100% to pray only
18 Feb 09:07 - hp Czy: Now u ahifted to 20% chase gals
18 Feb 09:07 - hp Hongxin: Church also Dun reject pple.
We don't judge.
But personally, the primary intentions of gg to church or school should be pray/worship and study respectively.
18 Feb 09:07 - hp Czy: Ist so hard to make it higher till u get a gf?
18 Feb 09:08 - hp Czy: When u do, dont u see u only have 100% left in praying?
18 Feb 09:08 - hp Czy: Cause the other option is fulfilled?
18 Feb 09:09 - hp Czy: Yes hx thanks for clarifying which also seems to help make my logic more practical
18 Feb 09:09 - hp Czy: And not to mention efficient
18 Feb 09:10 - Victor Cheong: In praying or studying or what not there's sure to be social interaction mah
18 Feb 09:10 - Victor Cheong: So if sparks fly and romance is out then ok lor
18 Feb 09:10 - hp Czy: Lol laid back again then
18 Feb 09:10 - hp Czy: Vic, u really have no intention of getting a gf do u?

18 Feb 09:17 - GZ: U mean Jesus won't forgive u?

18 Feb 09:18 - GZ: If Jesus don't, quit Christianity man
18 Feb 09:18 - GZ: It sux
18 Feb 09:54 - Liu Xuan: Interestingly I just read about Martin Luther's view of marriage, he encourages all Christian to have marriage! he himself being a monk married to his wife previously a nun.  As marriage is the most beautiful creation of God, everybody deserves it. It should be blessed, and not be condemned. And with that he revolutionized to Protestant Christianity. So dun be afraid to chase a gal in Church, uncle Victor, they deserve to be chased. And for those who dun quite understand God-he is a God of loving and he plans for the prosper and give hope to ppl, not a God who wants to condemn his own creations. We are made in the image of God. We deserve every good thing that God has prepared for us, including marriage.
18 Feb 09:55 - hp Czy: See? Even ur fellow christians agrees
18 Feb 09:56 - hp Czy: Vic, time to chg ur so called % , though.. i am just saying have more initiatives to ask arnd

18 Feb 09:58 - hp Czy: With trying to get gals in ur church
18 Feb 10:00 - Liu Xuan: Oh, but it must be in the prospect of marriage first. And seeking counsel would always be a good way to start with...
18 Feb 10:01 - hp Czy: Well, details not really needed... christians got thier own way of doing stuffs i dun care
18 Feb 10:01 - hp Czy: Just saying if u have a big network to use
18 Feb 10:02 - hp Czy: Use it.. else its a damn waste and people inside whose waiting for u are being stupid thanks to u
18 Feb 10:06 - hp Czy: Imagine noelle in anothet cell grp, diff frm hx, then hx forever only stay in his cell grp offering services, noelle forever waiting in her own cell grp giving services.... vic u wanna play waiting game?
18 Feb 10:08 - Noelle Hui Fen YONG: Hahaha. Correct me if I'm wrong, Vic. 

I think Vic is not saying that he doesn't want to chase ladies in church it's just that  he's not there with the main intention of finding a partner. He's there because he has a relationship with God and his presence there is out of gratitude for a God who is good and loving. Same ones for most of the other Christians who go to church every week. Don't think the women attend church with the intention to find a partner too. If it happens, then it's a happy gift from God.

But czy, I agree with ur advise that one way to find a life partner is to expand one's network.
18 Feb 10:09 - Liu Xuan: But before you start to chase a girl, you must understand her first, not juz becuz of her appearance, becuz appearance is not what that last, and it is what comes from within that gives the abundance of life. And Sorry Vic, maybe I was abit rush in judgement about your not chasing gals in church. Maybe it's juz you haven't met the one that suits you...
18 Feb 10:09 - hp Czy: Lol... hes not even looking in other cell grps
18 Feb 10:09 - hp Czy: Thats the damn problem
18 Feb 10:09 - hp Czy: And thats my only suggestion
18 Feb 10:10 - hp Czy: Which hx turn it into go church just to chase gals
18 Feb 10:10 - hp Czy: Tell me whose being the extremist here...
18 Feb 10:10 - Noelle Hui Fen YONG: üòÇ
18 Feb 10:11 - hp Czy: I noe its paiseh and seems despi to ask for intro in other grps...
18 Feb 10:12 - hp Czy: But i can just say i am despo, wats wrng in wanting a wife and a family??
18 Feb 10:12 - hp Hongxin: Huh? U were the me who told us that guys go to City Harvest just to jio girls le
18 Feb 10:12 - Liu Xuan: Haha, kayla, zy is justified. Lol
18 Feb 10:12 - hp Czy: Arloe
18 Feb 10:12 - hp Czy: Thats city harvest
18 Feb 10:12 - hp Czy: But they do pray rite
18 Feb 10:12 - hp Czy: Just to the weng god
18 Feb 10:12 - hp Czy: Wrng
18 Feb 10:12 - hp Czy: And the fking god is facing charges now
18 Feb 10:13 - hp Czy: And its not all wrng abt them
18 Feb 10:13 - hp Czy: They openly try to get a partner with same bekieves inside
18 Feb 10:16 - hp Czy: And 1 more thing thats not wrng with atrracting fuys to church to jio gals
18 Feb 10:17 - hp Czy: In logical aspect, if u dun come into contact, u wont know the thing, and so, if u able to have the person come into contact, the chance of the person being from 0 % believing in god, becomes a >0% chance
18 Feb 10:18 - hp Czy: Lol... why am i saying these to christians... makes me sound fking stupid trying to help them get more fellow christians
18 Feb 10:19 - hp Hongxin: That's your opinion. I respect that.
Personally, I Don't think a church is a dating agency. Neither is a school.
18 Feb 10:19 - hp Hongxin: There's a reason why dating agencies are set up.
18 Feb 10:20 - hp Czy: Hx, its not abt dating, its abt finding someone thats having the same believe and being in the same church
18 Feb 10:20 - hp Czy: Which will not have another prob of both being in diff church
18 Feb 10:21 - hp Czy: If u find outside and the person is of anothrr chruch
18 Feb 10:21 - hp Czy: Ask u to quit ur church join herz
18 Feb 10:21 - hp Czy: Would u??
18 Feb 10:22 - hp Czy: And to get people to have more contact with ur religion
18 Feb 10:22 - GZ: I agree man
18 Feb 10:22 - hp Czy: To open a chance that they will actually take interest in it
18 Feb 10:22 - GZ: Since Christians promote both parties to be Christians, what are the best chance of both being christian?
18 Feb 10:22 - GZ: When u find the other half I. Church!
18 Feb 10:23 - GZ: In
18 Feb 10:23 - GZ: 100% christian
18 Feb 10:23 - GZ: And they know ur habits n patterns
18 Feb 10:23 - GZ: Less quarrels
18 Feb 10:23 - GZ: Less conflicts
18 Feb 10:23 - hp Czy: Imagine my product is not known of person a, and i dont mention to person a, and person a have no interest or idea of my product.....how to sell????
18 Feb 10:24 - hp Czy: When people go to church with wrng intentions, if ur religion is strong enough, he most prob will chg
18 Feb 10:24 - hp Czy: And 100% chase dkirts become 100% service
18 Feb 10:25 - hp Czy: U telling me u dun welcome fellow christians thats having wrng intention previously?
18 Feb 10:25 - GZ: And ain't Christianity means acceptance to all?
18 Feb 10:26 - GZ: Even if u have the slightest thoughts of it?
18 Feb 10:27 - Liu Xuan: My view is its not up to us to judge anyone, as judgment is upon God. What we need to do is that : whatever you do, work heartily, as to the Lord, not to man. As you know you will receive inheritance from God. It is the Lord Christ you are serving. 
So the heart seems pretty important, it is the ultimate God that we need to give accountability. And He is a mercy Lord, he want us to repent from our sins, which comes from our heart sometimes. So that we can restore to the first image that he has made us to be.
18 Feb 10:27 - hp Czy: Lx
18 Feb 10:28 - hp Czy: U noe... hearts feelings chges
18 Feb 10:28 - hp Czy: When affected by surounding
18 Feb 10:28 - Liu Xuan: And God sees it all
18 Feb 10:28 - hp Czy: Thghts chg too
18 Feb 10:28 - Liu Xuan: God also see it
18 Feb 10:28 - hp Czy: I dun really care if he sees anot
18 Feb 10:29 - hp Czy: But would u want to have 1 more fellow christian or not to have???
18 Feb 10:29 - hp Czy: In ur case, its having save one more person
18 Feb 10:30 - hp Czy: When one stays in the mountains
18 Feb 10:30 - hp Czy: They will nver know the sea
18 Feb 10:30 - hp Czy: Yet when one is in the sea
18 Feb 10:30 - hp Czy: They never will know of the mountains
18 Feb 10:31 - hp Czy: How do u attract one from the moutains to the sea? I think love can...
18 Feb 10:35 - Liu Xuan: He will judge us according to what we think, as long as there's one more soul being saved, even the angel is celebrating about it. Not mentioning human. 
One thing is very important is that Human's love can fail, but God's love never fails. :)
18 Feb 10:35 - GZ: Sorry to say this
18 Feb 10:35 - GZ: No offense what
18 Feb 10:35 - GZ: But.. The last part
18 Feb 10:36 - GZ: Feels abit sad..
18 Feb 10:36 - Liu Xuan: Why leh?
18 Feb 10:36 - GZ: Coz..
18 Feb 10:36 - hp Czy: Cause humans love can fail
18 Feb 10:36 - hp Czy: Hi five
18 Feb 10:36 - GZ: I mean u have more faith in god than ur the other soul mate
18 Feb 10:37 - GZ: Then how's the rs gona work?
18 Feb 10:37 - GZ: If I marry my wife
18 Feb 10:37 - hp Czy: Imagine 20yrs down the road william and lx no longer love each other
18 Feb 10:37 - GZ: I gona have faith in her more than anything
18 Feb 10:37 - hp Czy: Then lx will at least have that last sentence
18 Feb 10:37 - GZ: Dots.. Zy
18 Feb 10:37 - GZ: That one abit over...
18 Feb 10:37 - hp Czy: Hmm agree
18 Feb 10:38 - GZ: I don't think it sounds right that u have more faith in something more than ur soul matr
18 Feb 10:38 - GZ: Mate*
18 Feb 10:38 - hp Czy: Just saying its sad cause my parents are like tat
18 Feb 10:38 - GZ: He or she is ur soul mate for a reason
18 Feb 10:38 - hp Czy: So if they have more faith in god
18 Feb 10:38 - hp Czy: At least they have that last part to save them
18 Feb 10:38 - GZ: In times of darkness he or she is the first one to be in contact with u, sees u, touch u, hug u
18 Feb 10:39 - GZ: That's my 2 cents
18 Feb 10:39 - hp Czy: But what abt those that divorce
18 Feb 10:39 - hp Czy: Who will save them??
18 Feb 10:39 - hp Czy: God rite
18 Feb 10:39 - hp Czy: At least for christians they still got thier god
18 Feb 10:40 - GZ: I mean that's why I remain free thinker
18 Feb 10:40 - GZ: Believe in self and the other half
18 Feb 10:40 - hp Czy: Hahaha tats cool also
18 Feb 10:40 - GZ: A rs won't work out if he or she is not ur number 1
18 Feb 10:40 - hp Czy: Actually thats way cooler
18 Feb 10:40 - hp Czy: Bigger risk, bigger rewards, hahaha
18 Feb 10:40 - GZ: He or she ain't my number 2 or spare or substitute
18 Feb 10:42 - hp Czy: There comes a time when ur other half die before u also
18 Feb 10:43 - hp Czy: Then u shall become like yanguo in the yrs without xiao
Long nv, alone and love her till death
18 Feb 10:44 - hp Czy: Oh man... thats sooo fking cool and heart breaking
18 Feb 10:45 - hp Czy: Christians have god to love though, so its not tat bad for them
18 Feb 10:46 - hp Czy: Helps in maintaining marriage too, imagine the 2 not loving each other anymore, but with gods love, they dont need another partner anyway
18 Feb 10:46 - hp Czy: So they can stay married and have no love for oneanother
18 Feb 10:47 - hp Czy: Just both have love for  God is enough
18 Feb 10:48 - Liu Xuan: On earth yes. We are physically, emotionally accountable to each other's soul mate. But when the time pass by, our  body become older, our motion become slower, or even for those who are success in career, got pride in their life, and think their spouse is getting not suitable to their status. We need to understand that marriage is made by God, what God makes cannot be separated by man. It's a covenant made by God. Because we are so loved by God so we can love our partner unconditionally.
18 Feb 10:48 - hp Czy: Hahaha
18 Feb 10:48 - hp Czy: Lx
18 Feb 10:48 - hp Czy: Human is not god
18 Feb 10:49 - hp Czy: U cant control the heart just by a understanding
18 Feb 10:49 - hp Czy: When u really reach the stage of mother teresa
18 Feb 10:49 - hp Czy: U will love all and everyone the same way
18 Feb 10:49 - hp Czy: Not just ur partner
18 Feb 10:50 - hp Czy: In tat, even when the initial love for man and women is gone, u will stay married, the love is gone teplaced by another kind of love
18 Feb 10:50 - hp Czy: But thats not the initial love
18 Feb 10:51 - hp Czy: Cause the initial man and women love mught fade, the love for all things... just like gods love in yr case
18 Feb 10:51 - hp Czy: Doesnt
18 Feb 10:53 - hp Czy: But in the case u cant reach the stage of loving everything, ur partner and ur love fades, and u cant rely on the teachings to maintain the love for ur partner, christians still have god to love them
18 Feb 10:56 - hp Czy: Human heart is very hard to control... faith can be very strong, but strong as rock or diamond, droplets  of water can wither them away... so gz choice is that he bears the consequences of it all, take all the risk himself
18 Feb 10:57 - hp Czy: Urs is ur believe in god helps to maintain things, at the end if all else fails, theres always God to love u
18 Feb 10:58 - hp Czy: Its easier imo to believe in God though
18 Feb 10:58 - hp Czy: GZ way is really hard, and very risky, but i find it damn cool
18 Feb 11:01 - hp Czy: In logic sense when both believe in god and maintain marriage faithfully, all goes well, but loads turn away from God before, and loads make mistakes even though they know its a mistake. Humans aint perfect... thats what makes them interesting
18 Feb 11:03 - 4/1 EdwarD: Gods love is something humans create out of the blue
18 Feb 11:03 - 4/1 EdwarD: To justify
18 Feb 11:03 - hp Czy: Hahaha
18 Feb 11:03 - hp Czy: Ed... for christians
18 Feb 11:03 - hp Czy: It exist before humans did
18 Feb 11:03 - 4/1 EdwarD: But how u know it exist when humans haven exist?
18 Feb 11:04 - hp Czy: Cause thats thier believe
18 Feb 11:04 - 4/1 EdwarD: Ya lo
18 Feb 11:04 - hp Czy: U have to think in thier case
18 Feb 11:04 - hp Czy: When talking to them
18 Feb 11:04 - 4/1 EdwarD: The belief is created out of nothing
18 Feb 11:04 - 4/1 EdwarD: Wat I'm saying is always question things n not follow blindly
18 Feb 11:04 - hp Czy: Its like a customer have a problem, u have to think in thier shoe to talk to them
18 Feb 11:05 - 4/1 EdwarD: I'm not customer service
18 Feb 11:05 - 4/1 EdwarD: I'm consultant
18 Feb 11:05 - hp Czy: Hahaha agree
18 Feb 11:10 - Liu Xuan: Starting from repentance, we took the first step to be closer to God, despite all we are first made in the image of God, it is because of sin that we fall short of God's glory. 
Despite all, our love can grow, and the love within the family can grow to be a blessing to community. After all family is the basic unit of community. 
And this might be a bit revolutionary but: sex is a sign of the covenant of marriage that is made by God. Married Couples need sex to renew their covenant of marriage. Sex is only holy and enjoyable when it is made within the marriage. Any of it that falls outside marriage: be it premarital sex, adultery, homosexual sex, is sin, and is not favored by God. God made a lot of rules for us, but it is intend for human's own good. It may look mundane that Christian go to church every Sunday , Christians follow a lot of rules like not gambling, no premarital sex, no lying, but is because God want us to have a balance relationship between other humans, and his intention is that no human(his own creation) is hurt, so he made this rules.
18 Feb 11:11 - 4/1 EdwarD: But how to prove it?
18 Feb 11:11 - hp Czy: How did this becomes sex discussion??
18 Feb 11:12 - hp Czy: Lx is super interested in it?
18 Feb 11:15 - hp Czy: Btw turning away from marriage doesnt mean u have mistress or wat
18 Feb 11:16 - hp Czy: Just like faith, love fades without maintainance
18 Feb 11:16 - hp Czy: U need to maintain sparks
18 Feb 11:16 - hp Czy: For it to renew
18 Feb 11:16 - hp Czy: And well.. people tend to get lazy
18 Feb 11:18 - Liu Xuan: @Edwad: by observing life, you can see God's hand in his creatures. 
@ZY: not only me, William also(haha, sorry darling) , happened someone introduce this book called Sex and the Supremacy of Christ, I started to read it. Which talks about sex, marriage, male, female, which all are creation of God, and God see good in his creations.
18 Feb 11:19 - 4/1 EdwarD: By observing life, u also can see Buddha teachings in nature
18 Feb 11:19 - hp Czy: No wonder u suddenly talk abt sex...
18 Feb 11:19 - 4/1 EdwarD: Y is Christian way the right way n not other religions
18 Feb 11:20 - hp Czy: Hahaha
18 Feb 11:20 - hp Czy: Cause they are christians
18 Feb 11:20 - 4/1 EdwarD: It's a legit ques ah

U want to share your life with him or her! U have similar idea and principles. Nothing to do with similar religion. Nobody say that u have to get married with someone of the same religion. Don't think too complicated.
18 Feb 22:37 - hp Czy: Lol... its not anyone... its God

1 Mar 18:29 - GZ: Try it seriously dont cheat its amazing
A MUST TRY!!!!!!!          ALZHEIMERS'  EYE TEST

(I love this part.. It's absolutely amazing!)   

Count every  "  F  " in the following text:

FINISHED  FILES ARE THE RE
SULT OF YEARS OF SCIENTI
FIC STUDY COMBINED  WITH
THE EXPERIENCE OF YEARS...  
(SEE  BELOW)


HOW MANY ? 
  







WRONG,  THERE ARE  6  --  no joke.
READ IT AGAIN !
Really, go Back and Try to find the  6 F's before you scroll down.

The reasoning behind is  further down.


The brain cannot  process "OF".

! or what? Go back and look again!!

Anyone who counts  all 6 "F's" on the first go is a genius.

Three  is normal, four is quite rare. 

Send this to your  friends. 
It will drive them crazy!!
Good isnt it.....üò¥

9 Mar 16:29 - 02S21 Willam: If u all were to be parents (2 of us here are alr parents), pls coorperate with the teacher and side with the sch. If we say ur child is expressive (aka talkative) and active (walk around in class alot without permission), accept them rather than deny.
9 Mar 16:32 - hp Czy: Lol hx might
9 Mar 16:32 - hp Czy: The rest we shall see la
9 Mar 16:50 - hp Ivan: Parents will be naturally protective over their own children
9 Mar 16:51 - hp Ivan: Lol..maybe they can't accept the truth so they can only deny..

27 Mar 15:47 - hp Ivan: Playing bf ?
27 Mar 15:48 - hp Czy: Brave fontier
27 Mar 16:12 - hp Czy: Btw, just a question since hx like not much interest in giving respect to lky, is he respected and trusted by christians??
27 Mar 16:12 - hp Czy: Or is he hated by christians???
27 Mar 18:16 - hp Czy: Btw i reach the korean resturant liao
27 Mar 18:16 - hp Hongxin: Noelle is late.
27 Mar 18:17 - hp Czy: I in the resturant liao
27 Mar 18:17 - hp Hongxin: Ok. Should PM me ma.. Why put here?
27 Mar 18:21 - hp Czy: Oh ok
27 Mar 18:27 - hp Hongxin: Czy, As to your question, no relation to Christian and LKY.
I think many went to queue up.
I personally don't believe in queuing up 7hrs to pay tribute. There are many places to do it. Even govt also advocate people to go to the community sites.
If LKY is still alive, I don't think he will condone it too. It's totally against his productivity drive.
27 Mar 18:27 - hp Czy: Hahaha its not abt that
27 Mar 18:28 - hp Czy: Its something else totally more of something to do for yourself
27 Mar 18:30 - hp Czy: Its a act of gratitude for someone that has done alot for you. A kind of act of appreciation
27 Mar 18:30 - hp Czy: How much effort u put in is depicted by u and what form is also depicted by u
27 Mar 18:31 - hp Czy: Anyway, lky says that if the cabinet is formed solely of christians, then it would be a very intolerable cabinet
27 Mar 18:35 - hp Czy: Very true and very wise in my opinion, cause rules of a religion is not something to impose on a country, cause thier views are too much influenced and therefore not suitable to be used on alot of other people and things that happen around. In the end, leaders is best to be open minded and not to be ruled by a single religion
27 Mar 18:35 - hp Czy: Especially when rules of a religion mostly built around its survival at the very core
27 Mar 18:41 - hp Czy: I dont show gratitude to imaginery stuffs, so i should at least do something for those that have done something for me
27 Mar 18:42 - hp Czy: Even if they are dead lol
27 Mar 20:12 - GZ: I agreed
27 Mar 20:12 - GZ: Lky is our fonding father
27 Mar 20:12 - GZ: He can't be wrong
27 Mar 20:12 - GZ: Someone so wise
27 Mar 20:15 - 4/1 EdwarD: An teacher wrote this n said to his students-

"Today, there was this secondary school kid ask me ramdomly, what has Lee Kuan Yew done for him? So I say to him:

The moment you woke up, you are in your HDB flat. His housing legacy.

Once you step into your toilet/bathroom, you have the tap with potable water. His water legacy

Once you use the bus and MRT to travel, you are better than your parents in earlier days, having to travel to Shenton Way from Toa Payoh for 2 hours or even worse. His public transport legacy.

You have shades of trees along the roads and streets to keep yourself cool. His greening legacy.

You do not have to worry going out late at night with your parents, without much fear of being mugged. His law and order legacy.

Our country is safely secured from external armed threats. His civilian armed forces legacy. 

You have good quality, bilingual education because he believed investing on youths. His education legacy.

So what have he done for you, your parents, and the future generations to come?"
27 Mar 22:11 - 4/1 EdwarD: Czy how's the queue situation there a

28 Mar 17:11 - Victor Cheong: Bullsh*t. Since.when did it look so good?
28 Mar 17:11 - Victor Cheong: False advertising
28 Mar 17:11 - hp Hongxin: Czy & Vic, why didn't we get to see such nice stuff when we were in the same place?

Because we frigging had our backpacks on our back.

Stupidest thing I've done.

Lesson learnt for everyone
28 Mar 17:12 - hp Hongxin: We were too shag & too rushed to appreciate.
28 Mar 17:12 - hp Hongxin: Nuff said
28 Mar 17:12 - Victor Cheong: Cb this was the water cave which we got drenched
28 Mar 17:12 - hp Hongxin: Yes.. It's the same cb water cave
28 Mar 17:12 - hp Czy: We did see...
28 Mar 17:13 - hp Czy: Just the water not so nice nia... the torches spoil the sight
28 Mar 17:14 - hp Czy: Or that u guys didn look straight at all
28 Mar 17:14 - hp Czy: Its curntain after curtain in the cave, but most of it on top of the torch lights is invisible cause we blinded by torches

9 Apr 18:25 - Victor Cheong: But I'm an audio layman. Can't tell the difference
9 Apr 18:29 - hp Czy: They are all pretty good for most people till u are able to differenciate every thing at different ampheres and that in a ochestra u can accurately identify how many different instruments there is... then when u compare a earphone thats bassy for rock musics and clarity +flat response for vocal.... and a little bass with max clarity for classic music
9 Apr 18:30 - hp Czy: Sengeisser is g
9 Apr 18:30 - hp Czy: Gd but just see model lo
9 Apr 18:32 - hp Czy: Loved ultimate ears(logitech) but they arent selling in sg anymore, so sec choice is audio tech
9 Apr 18:35 - hp Czy: And imo... 200plus to 400 plus is abt the amount inspend in 3 yrs chging multiple sets of 70plus earphones
9 Apr 18:35 - hp Czy: 2 to 3 piece per year.... especially if i travel alot, the watrantee is a saver, gives u a new one every time it spoils

29 Apr 14:08 - 02S21 Willam: His injury serious, torn ligaments and stuff
29 Apr 14:08 - GZ: Oh
29 Apr 14:08 - Victor Cheong: That and lbj has been the spurs whipping boy for the last few seasons
29 Apr 14:08 - GZ: Torn ligament?
29 Apr 14:09 - GZ: Fair share of here n there ba
29 Apr 14:09 - 02S21 Willam: Yes shoulder area for k love
29 Apr 14:09 - GZ: LBJ cooked spurs in 2 seasons ago
29 Apr 14:09 - GZ: Den spurs revenge
29 Apr 14:09 - 02S21 Willam: Ray ray did
29 Apr 14:09 - 02S21 Willam: 2 seasons ago
29 Apr 14:09 - 02S21 Willam: Not lbj

29 Apr 14:10 - GZ: Had a chance?
29 Apr 14:10 - GZ: His the king for a reason
29 Apr 14:10 - GZ: Thou his diminishing now
29 Apr 14:10 - Victor Cheong: King is just something people hyped abt him for advertising and marketing purposes
29 Apr 14:11 - Victor Cheong: And nba isn't a one man sport
29 Apr 14:11 - Victor Cheong: Must consider leh 
Pops beats the cavs coach hands down
29 Apr 14:11 - Victor Cheong: Spurs have a deeper bench
29 Apr 14:12 - Victor Cheong: Spurs have a solid core that's been ard for many many many years
29 Apr 14:12 - Victor Cheong: While lbj and team chemistry not as good
29 Apr 14:12 - Victor Cheong: That and old man Duncan doesn't whine when. The air con broke down and caused lbj to have massive cramps lol
29 Apr 14:13 - 02S21 Willam: See next round 1st.
29 Apr 14:13 - 02S21 Willam: gws is playing the best bball of all their careers
29 Apr 14:14 - GZ: Precisely all u mentioned viv
29 Apr 14:14 - GZ: Vic
29 Apr 14:14 - Victor Cheong: Gsw.are.monsters now lol
29 Apr 14:14 - GZ: Are what makes lbj on even ground with spurs
29 Apr 14:14 - GZ: He did ebeything without what u said
29 Apr 14:14 - GZ: Without pops
29 Apr 14:14 - GZ: Without deeper bench
29 Apr 14:14 - GZ: Without chemistry
29 Apr 14:15 - GZ: With complains about aircon
29 Apr 14:15 - GZ: Imagine if lbj have all u said
29 Apr 14:15 - GZ: What will happened?
29 Apr 14:15 - GZ: If lbj is under pops?
29 Apr 14:15 - GZ: Deeper benchm
29 Apr 14:15 - GZ: With no complains
29 Apr 14:15 - GZ: And etc..
29 Apr 14:16 - Victor Cheong: U forgot to mention constant jumping btw teams
29 Apr 14:16 - GZ: But truth be told
29 Apr 14:16 - GZ: He came to where spurs is
29 Apr 14:16 - GZ: Without everything u mentioned
29 Apr 14:16 - Victor Cheong: He's in the eastern conference lah
29 Apr 14:16 - GZ: The more u say the more ammo u giving me
29 Apr 14:17 - Victor Cheong: The super uber  weak side of the nba
29 Apr 14:17 - GZ: Err...
29 Apr 14:17 - GZ: Not Much diff leh
29 Apr 14:17 - GZ: U say till like that
29 Apr 14:17 - GZ: U show me history records of east vs west lor
29 Apr 14:17 - GZ: And must be triumpting
29 Apr 14:17 - GZ: Den I believe
29 Apr 14:17 - Victor Cheong: The number 8 team in the western conference last year would have been the number 4 in the east
29 Apr 14:17 - GZ: Trashing
29 Apr 14:18 - 02S21 Willam: East is weaker this and last season due to W-L records
29 Apr 14:18 - GZ: den we talk about lbj team vs west lor
29 Apr 14:18 - GZ: Weaker yes
29 Apr 14:18 - GZ: But not a huge
29 Apr 14:18 - Victor Cheong: Go read nba.com 
the weekly power rankings. so far West has been over 55% win percentage over the east
29 Apr 14:19 - Victor Cheong: For the last 2 years I believe
29 Apr 14:19 - GZ: 55-45
29 Apr 14:19 - GZ: Not trashing
29 Apr 14:19 - GZ: So the weak is there
29 Apr 14:19 - GZ: Yes
29 Apr 14:19 - GZ: But ain't significant
29 Apr 14:20 - GZ: Pops + deeper bench + aircon
29 Apr 14:20 - GZ: I believe aLL this MoRE significant
29 Apr 14:20 - Victor Cheong: IMG-20150429-WA0002.jpg (file attached)
29 Apr 14:20 - GZ: Than eastern?
29 Apr 14:20 - GZ: No?
29 Apr 14:21 - GZ: Explain?
29 Apr 14:22 - Victor Cheong: Look at the number 8 of Western conference and see how it fares in the east
29 Apr 14:23 - Victor Cheong: Number 2 cavs. Will be number 7 in the west
29 Apr 14:24 - GZ: And then?
29 Apr 14:24 - GZ: Lol
29 Apr 14:24 - GZ: [29/04 1:14 pm] Desmond: Precisely all u mentioned viv
[29/04 1:14 pm] Desmond: Are what makes lbj on even ground with spurs
[29/04 1:14 pm] Desmond: He did ebeything without what u said
[29/04 1:14 pm] Desmond: Without pops
[29/04 1:14 pm] Desmond: Without deeper bench
[29/04 1:14 pm] Desmond: Without chemistry
[29/04 1:15 pm] Desmond: With complains about aircon
[29/04 1:15 pm] Desmond: Imagine if lbj have all u said
[29/04 1:15 pm] Desmond: What will happened?
[29/04 1:15 pm] Desmond: If lbj is under pops?
[29/04 1:15 pm] Desmond: Deeper benchm
[29/04 1:15 pm] Desmond: With no complains
29 Apr 14:25 - GZ: Doesn't answer my point of direction
29 Apr 14:25 - 02S21 Willam: I do not doubt lbj's strengths which is being all round. He doesnt dominate like kobe or Jordan. But u cant deny he has an easier route to the finals. Eventually many things may happen to affect the final outcome but it has shown u need both star power and a deep bench to win
29 Apr 14:25 - 02S21 Willam: Which both factors as of now leans slightly more towards gsw or spurs than cavs
29 Apr 14:26 - 02S21 Willam: Imho la
29 Apr 14:28 - GZ: I agree!
29 Apr 14:28 - GZ: My point is with lbj
29 Apr 14:28 - GZ: He bring his team
29 Apr 14:28 - GZ: To where spurs is
29 Apr 14:28 - GZ: That's all
29 Apr 14:28 - GZ: Even if His in west
29 Apr 14:28 - GZ: His in the playoff
29 Apr 14:29 - Victor Cheong: Which is Williams pt. The east has  an easier time going to the playoffs
29 Apr 14:29 - GZ: Ya I nv deny that
29 Apr 14:30 - GZ: 0.1 also easier
29 Apr 14:30 - GZ: My point is
29 Apr 14:30 - GZ: Its not trashing easy
29 Apr 14:30 - Victor Cheong: It's quite trashing lol
29 Apr 14:31 - Victor Cheong: IMG-20150429-WA0004.jpg (file attached)
29 Apr 14:31 - Victor Cheong: Last year's results
29 Apr 14:32 - Victor Cheong: Lbj is good but not supremely good
29 Apr 14:35 - GZ: Lol
29 Apr 14:35 - GZ: Actually if u wana say
29 Apr 14:35 - Victor Cheong: U see just to get into the playoffs in the west, u have go get almost 50 wins 
In East?  38.
29 Apr 14:35 - Victor Cheong: That's a lot of difference
29 Apr 14:35 - GZ: Our point nite is east vs west rite
29 Apr 14:36 - GZ: Den u must filter away data that east vs east in he 50 wihs
29 Apr 14:36 - GZ: N see east vs west
29 Apr 14:36 - GZ: N viveversea
29 Apr 14:36 - GZ: I can have a 90% record against west
29 Apr 14:36 - GZ: But 50% against east
29 Apr 14:36 - GZ: This means what?
29 Apr 14:36 - GZ: I can have 50% west
29 Apr 14:37 - GZ: And 60 wins with 100% east wins
29 Apr 14:37 - GZ: This means?
29 Apr 14:56 - Victor Cheong: Must I spell it out? It means getting to the playoffs is easier if u are in the east
29 Apr 14:56 - Victor Cheong: Based on data that is
29 Apr 14:58 - GZ: What data
29 Apr 14:59 - GZ: Ur data ain't accurate
29 Apr 14:59 - GZ: There are counter elements
29 Apr 14:59 - GZ: Some teams don't like eastern style
29 Apr 14:59 - GZ: Some like western
29 Apr 14:59 - GZ: So fare better with western
29 Apr 14:59 - GZ: U need filter them
29 Apr 14:59 - GZ: If really wana say
29 Apr 14:59 - GZ: Thou I believe
29 Apr 14:59 - GZ: Western should be better
29 Apr 14:59 - GZ: But by ard single digit %
29 Apr 15:01 - Victor Cheong: Wtf eastern and western style? U think this is Chinese martial arts ninja vs eastern western mma  is it? 
Basketball leh dude

29 Apr 15:11 - Victor Cheong: Basketball is simple.  Pass well shoot well score well
29 Apr 15:11 - Victor Cheong: But we will let William answer your question also. Maybe I'm wrong

5 May 15:04 - Victor Cheong: The bad apples don't represent the whole tree
5 May 15:04 - hp Czy: Dont even bother about monks vic, they give up everything in life, to learn the wisdom of buddhism, no gf no asset no relative no nothing
5 May 15:05 - hp Czy: Vic
5 May 15:05 - Victor Cheong: There are monks in Myanmar that practice violence and discrimination too u know?
5 May 15:05 - Victor Cheong: Religion isn't pretty
5 May 15:05 - hp Czy: The moment u bring up the monk story... whatever u say afterwards about 1 bad apple is pointless already
5 May 15:05 - hp Czy: Those aint monks
5 May 15:05 - hp Czy: Monks live in temple
5 May 15:06 - hp Czy: And chant all fking day and talk about scripts
5 May 15:06 - hp Czy: If i shave my head
5 May 15:06 - hp Czy: And call myself a monk
5 May 15:07 - hp Czy: While eating meat, hunting animals, playing with gals
5 May 15:07 - hp Czy: I still call myself a monk
5 May 15:07 - hp Czy: U believe?
5 May 15:07 - hp Czy: Hahaha
5 May 15:08 - Victor Cheong: Isn't is the same with kh?  He cheats his own church, yet still call himself a christian, a pastor a leader 
Only those without eyes believe in him now
5 May 15:08 - hp Czy: Erm
5 May 15:08 - hp Czy: Diff
5 May 15:08 - hp Czy: He got believers
5 May 15:09 - hp Czy: Those i myanmar
5 May 15:09 - hp Czy: Doesnt have believers
5 May 15:09 - hp Czy: U see
5 May 15:09 - hp Czy: Thats the main diff
5 May 15:09 - hp Czy: Between christianity
5 May 15:09 - hp Czy: And budhism
5 May 15:10 - hp Czy: One have a God and his ambasadors that spreads Gods teachings
5 May 15:10 - hp Czy: One doesnt...
5 May 15:10 - Victor Cheong: What makes u think those monks don't have believers? 
Who are.they being violent to?
The illegal immigrants. And who do u think are those pple who believe with those monks? Probably people who also don't like those illegal immigrants
5 May 15:10 - hp Czy: Vic
5 May 15:11 - hp Czy: Go read the most basic rule
5 May 15:11 - hp Czy: For budhism
5 May 15:11 - hp Czy: And compare it
5 May 15:11 - hp Czy: With christianity
5 May 15:11 - Victor Cheong: Ok lah. Even in the bible they say there are false people preaching abt god
5 May 15:11 - hp Czy: No
5 May 15:11 - Victor Cheong: Take that kh as a classic case ok?
5 May 15:11 - hp Czy: How many times
5 May 15:11 - hp Czy: Must i repeat
5 May 15:12 - hp Czy: There is no God in buddhism
5 May 15:12 - hp Czy: No fking person prays to any buddha
5 May 15:13 - hp Czy: Theres no fking use in praying to any buddha, at most u can ask for help to make your live better, even that u have to do alot of kind deeds to repay what u ask or u get retribution
5 May 15:14 - hp Czy: Alot of times not by simply donating money...
5 May 15:14 - hp Czy: And help, is given in the sense of directions
5 May 15:15 - hp Czy: In buddhism, the chantings isnt chanting to buddha or the dead
5 May 15:15 - hp Czy: Its for the living
5 May 15:16 - hp Czy: There is never any ambassoador of buddha
5 May 15:17 - hp Czy: Even the freak in tibet, is someone who trained himself till the level he can be reborned keeping his previous life memories
5 May 15:17 - hp Czy: And to continue to train himself in the next life..
5 May 15:18 - hp Czy: Loads of fking ang mohs actually have parts of thier previous life memories in them
5 May 15:19 - hp Czy: Got fking kid newborn that is able to speak some words
5 May 15:19 - hp Czy: Those are freaks of nature i would deem them to be
5 May 15:20 - hp Czy: Not impossible, since the very basic of survival is crafted into the dna of alot of animals
5 May 15:24 - hp Czy: Anyway the world is already made like that, just live with the flow and let ur life end, theres no meaning in geting a ton of money, enough to spend without much worries, a job that is fun to do, its enough to go by for the rest of ur life
5 May 15:25 - hp Czy: Being too bent on having more money nver ends in anything good
5 May 15:25 - hp Czy: Being too bent on saving up is also the same
5 May 15:25 - hp Czy: Being too bent on geting a relationship nvr ends well
5 May 15:26 - hp Czy: Being too bent on keeping a relationship going never ends well either
5 May 15:28 - hp Czy: Expectations causes pain, discomfort, unhappiness, complains, sadness. 
A goal isnt a expectation, its something you work effortlessly towards, so that you can give yourself a purpose to be alife.
5 May 15:30 - hp Czy: The complains that have, will not be a complain anymore, if you dont have expectations that is not met
5 May 15:31 - hp Czy: And if you dont have hate for someone or something, you wont have love for it either. Vice versal...
5 May 15:33 - hp Czy: The maintanence to a relationship, needs both love and hate, and 1 more thing, torlerance.
5 May 15:34 - hp Czy: Which gz currently have both
5 May 15:34 - hp Czy: Since hes fking complaining...

9 May 19:57 - GZ: Whatever u call it
9 May 19:58 - Victor Cheong: Normal thor  strength...cpt shield is stronger as in thor can't break it
9 May 19:58 - Victor Cheong: However if u consider thor to be infused with the odin force , then thor can break it
9 May 19:59 - Victor Cheong: Odin force is basically thor's  big daddy power. The power of asgard
9 May 19:59 - Victor Cheong: In which in the comics, thor inherits after big daddy O died
9 May 19:59 - GZ: So odin is very strong?
9 May 20:00 - Victor Cheong: Just because the shield can't be broken doesn't mean cpt can't be hurt hiding behind it.
9 May 20:00 - Victor Cheong: Cosmic

9 May 20:05 - Victor Cheong: He's considered one of the most powerful heroes in marvel
9 May 20:06 - Victor Cheong: And he's the servant of galactus who gave him only a tiny bit of the cosmic power

9 May 20:34 - Victor Cheong: Thanos had the gauntlet and he literally wiped the floor with every single one in marvel
9 May 20:34 - Victor Cheong: That includes the cosmic beings by the way
9 May 20:34 - Victor Cheong: Without breaking a sweat

9 May 20:42 - Victor Cheong: Lol..The reason thanos always loses is because overconfident
9 May 20:42 - Victor Cheong: Or if u think of his own words....He subconsciously creates the means of his own defeat
9 May 20:43 - Victor Cheong: He allows pple to defeat him
9 May 20:44 - Victor Cheong: Most wanted because oh u know he has almost caused the destruction of the whole universe multiple times
9 May 20:44 - Victor Cheong: And no one has been able to kill him off permanently

9 May 21:02 - Victor Cheong: Pple like beyonder  are neither good or bad
9 May 21:03 - Victor Cheong: While thanos  is pure evil in the past
9 May 21:03 - Victor Cheong: He was a nihilist. Aka everything must die to appease mistress death

9 May 21:08 - Victor Cheong: Silver surfer has the might but not as smart or cunning as thanos
9 May 21:09 - 02S21 Willam: Beyonder has intervened before
9 May 21:09 - Victor Cheong: Adam warlock is kinda like thanos foil though
9 May 21:09 - GZ: But if u ask me
9 May 21:09 - GZ: Marvel seem to always bias against the bad guys
9 May 21:09 - GZ: Dont u feel the bad n good
9 May 21:09 - GZ: Don't balance?
9 May 21:10 - Victor Cheong: They can't have a comic where the bad guy wins. Editors wouldn't allow it
9 May 21:10 - Victor Cheong: Later pple.complain say encourages pple to be bad
9 May 21:13 - GZ: No no
9 May 21:13 - GZ: I mean as jn
9 May 21:13 - GZ: Bias to the bad guys
9 May 21:13 - GZ: Means the bad guys are op

A woman is having an affair during the day while her husband is at work. Her 9 year old son comes home unexpectedly, sees them and hides in the bedroom closet to watch. The woman‚Äôs husband also comes home. She puts her lover in the closet, not realizing that the little boy is in there already.

The little boy says, ‚ÄúIts dark in here.‚Äù

The man says, ‚ÄúYes, it is.‚Äù

Boy ~ ‚ÄúI have a baseball.‚Äù

Man ~ ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nice.‚Äù

Boy ~ ‚ÄúWant to buy it?‚Äù

Man ~ ‚ÄúNo, thanks.‚Äù

Boy ~ ‚ÄúMy dad‚Äôs outside.‚Äù

Man ~ ‚ÄúOK, how much?‚Äù

Boy ~ ‚Äú$250?

In the next few weeks, it happens again that the boy and the lover are in the closet together.

Boy ~ ‚ÄúIts dark in here.‚Äù

Man ~ ‚ÄúYes, it is.‚Äù

Boy ~ ‚ÄúI have a baseball glove.‚Äù

The lover remembering the last time, asks the boy, ‚ÄúHow much?‚Äù

Boy ~ ‚Äú$750?

Man ~ ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

A few days later, the father says to the boy, ‚ÄúGrab your glove, let‚Äôs go outside and have a game of catch.‚Äù

The boy says, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt, I sold my baseball and my glove.‚Äù

The father asks, ‚ÄúHow much did you sell them for?‚Äù

Boy ~ ‚Äú$1,000?

The father says, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs terrible to overcharge your friends like that‚Ä¶that is way more than those two things cost. I‚Äôm going to take you to church and make you confess.‚Äù

They go to the church and the father makes the little boy sit in the confession booth and he closes the door.

The boy says, ‚ÄúDark in here.‚Äù

The priest says, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt start that crap again.‚Äù

19 May 18:41 - hp Czy: Will u die willingly and part with ur love ones?
19 May 18:43 - hp Czy: Tons of other ways to enjoy ur time without spending it on building ur family, earning to take care of ur kid, sac all ur time to worry abt ur family
19 May 18:44 - hp Czy: Not saying any of that is bad, just a matter of choice and its not exactly a must follow rule to a lifes progress
19 May 18:52 - hp Czy: The best gift in this world, is a choice of how to die is given to u.
19 May 18:54 - hp Czy: And the best gift after dieing, is a choice of whats next. Cause in the end, we didnt have a choice to be born, we didnt have a choice to not die. The only choice u have is to feel happy while things progress, no matter what it is
19 May 18:58 - 2 Cy: ÈöèÁºòÂêß.. Enjoy what u r doing now is more impt. ^.^... Don't think too much haha
